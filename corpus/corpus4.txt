TITLE: Hydrology and Glaciology of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica - glacier mass balance, ablation and movement and melt record determined by monitoring of stream flow and lake level of glacier fed streams and lakes. ABSTRACT: A hydrological glaciological study was conducted in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica from the 1969 70 summer until the 1990 91 season. The purpose of the hydrological glaciological programme was to study present fluctuations of selected glaciers and of lakes and streams fed by meltwater because these fluctuations are indicators of climate change in this part of Antarctica. Knowledge of the interactions of glaciers and lakes and streams fed by meltwater in the dry valleys with present climate is needed for better interpretation of the history of these glaciers and lakes and for prediction of their future behaviour if the climate changes. The research program includes direct measurements of glacier mass balance and glacier margins and indirect measurements of glacier melt recorded by stream flow and changes in lake level. Stream flow was monitored on the Onyx River and various other meltwater streams in the Wright Valley throughout the study and more recently near the outlet of the Upper Victoria Lake in Victoria Valley, downstream from the Garwood Glacier lake in the Garwood Valley and at three sites on the Adams and Miers streams in the Miers Valley to expand the spatial variability. Water samples were collected at some sites and analysed for suspended sediment particles. Water temperature was recorded on the Onyx River. The water level of lakes throughout the Dry Valleys was monitored including Lake Vanda and Lake Brownworth in the Wright Valley, Lake Vida and Upper Victoria Lake in Victoria Valley, Lake Vashka and Lake Webb in the Barwick Valley, Lake Fryxell, Lake Chad (Hoare), Lake Henderson and Lake Bonney in the Taylor Valley, Lake Joyce and Lake House in the Pearce Valley and Lake Miers in the Miers Valley. Measurements were generally recorded at the beginning of the summer and again at the end of the summer. Continuous monitoring of Lake Vanda was conducted throughout the summer and later in the programme at Don Juan Pond (1980 81 season). Mass balances, ablation and other measurements were measured since 1969 on several glaciers within the Dry Valleys including the Sykes, Alberich, Heimdall, Upper Wright, Lower Wright, Clarke, Meserve, Bartley, Hart, Goodspeed, Denton and the Wilson Piedmont Glaciers in the Wright Valley, the Upper Victoria, Lower Victoria and Packard Glaciers in the Victoria Valley, the Upper Taylor, La Croix, Suess, Canada and Commonwealth Glaciers in the Taylor Valley and the Miers and Adams Glaciers in the Miers Valley. Not all measurements were made at each glacier in each season. Throughout the seasons of monitoring, climate data was collected. Daily observations by the investigators was coupled with the installation of met stations at various sites for various amounts of time..

TITLE: MODIS Terra Sea Ice Extent Daily L3 Global 1km EASE-Grid Night V003. ABSTRACT: Sea ice products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) include level 2 swath data and level 3 gridded day and night composites, at 1 km resolution. Level 3 products consist of tiles of data, approximately 1200 km by 1200 km in area, gridded in a Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (EASE-Grid) projection. The sea ice algorithm uses a Normalized Difference Sea Ice Index (NDSI) and other criteria to distinguish sea ice from open ocean, based on reflective characteristics. The level 3 night product (MOD29P1N3) contains the following fields: Ice Surface Temperature (IST), IST Pixel QA, and Sea Ice by IST. The data also contain local and global metadata. Latitude and longitude geolocation fields are at 5 km resolution, while all other fields are at 1 km resolution. Sea ice data are in HDF-EOS format and are available by ftp. MODIS sea ice products are considered provisional at this time. Product quality may not be optimal, and incremental product improvements are still occurring. This data set represents Version 3 (V003) of the MODIS processing scheme. The V003 collection contains reprocessed V001 data from 5 March 2001 onward and V003 data from 24 May 2001 onward. V003 data contain processing refinements accommodating algorithm, instrument and calibration stabilization. V003 start dates will continually shift to earlier dates as V001 data are reprocessed to V003. After V003 data are generated for a given day, the V001 data for the same day will still be available for ordering through the EOS Data Gateway (EDG) for at least six months. Eventually, V003 data will completely replace V001 data..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Daily Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Global temperature database: 500 stations. Measurements since 1720. ABSTRACT: Rimfrost is a 100% free of charge website containing temperature measurements from more than 500 observation stations worldwide. These have been chosen, so that from both a national and a global perspective, the measurements, when statistically corrected, shall give the most reliable estimates of global temperature change. As climate development in the major industrial nations is expected to be of major interest, USA is represented with 25 weather stations, China with approximately 20, Russia with 25, Germany with 44, U.K. with 25, France with 10, Japan with 10, India with 30 etc. Climate change in Northern Atlantic region is also considered to be important. Because of this the Nordic nations have been especially well instrumented. Norway with its long coastline with the Atlantic Ocean has approx. 50 stations, Sweden approx. 30 and Finland 10. This is a natural reason for the development of Rimfrost by a University College in this region (NITH OSLO). The Rimfrost database contains mainly long time series measurements. We have consciously chosen observation stations that have measured temperature over long time periods. This gives the best conditions for obtaining more insight into how the climate has changed. Uppsala has measurements from approx. 1720, Stykkisholmur (Iceland) from 1830, New York from 1822, Berlin from 1701, London from 1840, Beijing from 1841, Calcutta from 1816 etc. In many cases the observation station has been moved and the local climate has changed through, for example, increased urbanization. In such cases climate researchers have tried to homogenize measurements in order they can be as comparable as possible over long periods of time. Rimfrost contains reasonably modern analytical tools for extended time series. The system's major strength is that it contains global data series. These can be combined in a variety of ways and form the basis for detailed studies and modeling. The analytical tools also include temperature trend analyses. This makes it possible to calculate the average change for all weather stations in a particular country. It is also possible to compare groups of countries. (Ex G8-countries) Rimfrost is multilingual. So far it is available in English (standard), German, Spanish, Finnish,Icelandic, Swedish and Norwegian. More languages are to come..

TITLE: Black Sea Red Sea Oxygen Isotope and Terrigeneous Flux Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of Black Sea Red Sea Oxygen Isotope and Terrigeneous Flux Data. High-resolution sediment cores from the southwestern Black Sea and the northernmost Gulf of Aqaba were used to infer hydroclimatic changes in northern Anatolia and the northern Red Sea region during the last ~7500 years. Red Sea, Gulf of Aqaba, core GeoB 5804-4: GeoB 5804-4 (29 deg. 30.1'N, 34 deg. 57.4'E; 464 m water depth) Black Sea, cores GeoB 7622-2 and 7625-2: GeoB 7622-2 (41 deg. 32.1'N, 31 deg. 10.1'E, 1305 m water depth) GeoB 7625-2 (41 deg. 26.7'N, 31 deg. 04.0'E, 1242 m water depth) Abstract Paleoenvironmental proxy data for ocean properties, eolian sediment input, and continental rainfall based on high-resolution analyses of sediment cores from the southwestern Black Sea and the northernmost Gulf of Aqaba were used to infer hydroclimatic changes in northern Anatolia and the northern Red Sea region during the last ~7500 years. Pronounced and coherent multicentennial variations in these records reveal patterns that strongly resemble modern temperature and rainfall anomalies related to the Arctic Oscillation  North Atlantic Oscillation (AO NAO). These patterns suggest a prominent role of AO NAO-like atmospheric variability during the Holocene beyond interannual to interdecadal timescales, most likely originating from solar output changes..

TITLE: Neon and other noble gas measurements in ice core samples from Vostok and Megadunes. ABSTRACT: Neon argon ratios in ice core samples from three sites: GISP2, Greenland, and Vostok and Megadunes, Antarctica. These samples show that neon is not preserved in ice core samples, but rather leaks out of stored samples. The Megadunes samples were taken using "Craig Can" technology, which involves putting the sample in an evacuated container immediately after core recovery. This prevents the loss of neon. These Megadunes samples show neon values close to atmospheric, in contrast to samples that have been stored in freezers for years, and support the interpretation that neon leaks out of stored samples..

TITLE: Sea Ice Charts of the Russian Arctic in Gridded Format, 1933-2006. ABSTRACT: The Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg, Russia, produces sea ice charts for safety of navigation in the polar regions and for other operational and scientific purposes. Arctic charts from 1933 through 2006 are collected in this data set. Chart frequency and spatial coverage varies, but charts were compiled every 10 days during the navigation season, and monthly for the rest of the year, over most of the series. There is a gap with no charts from 1993 through 1996. Chart coverage focuses on the Northern Sea Route, although later charts extend into the central Arctic. The charts were compiled from a variety of data sources, with heavy reliance on regular reconnaissance flights for most of the series until 1992. Early paper charts were digitized, and the entire series, including later charts that were produced entirely digitally, were converted to Sea Ice Grid (SIGRID) format at AARI. AARI provided code to read the SIGRID data and convert it to a format close to Equal Area Scalable (EASE)-Grid. NSIDC completed the conversion to EASE-Grid. The EASE-Grid is in a Lambert equal-area projection with 12.5 km cell size. Total ice concentration, as well as partial concentrations for multiyear, first-year, new young ice (ice younger than first-year ice), and fast ice, are given in EASE-Grid (binary), SIGRID (ASCII), and browse (PNG) files. Data are available via FTP. This data set replaces and updates the previous data set, AARI 10-Day Arctic Ocean EASE-Grid Sea Ice Observations (nsidc-0050, discontinued December 2007), and the Russian Arctic charts on the Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas (http:  nsidc.org data g01962.html).

TITLE: Hourly Mesosphere Wind Estimates (Meteor Winds) for Stations in Antarctica, Arctic Ocean, and Europe. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of meridional and zonal hourly winds accompanied with hourly meteor rates, as measured by ground-based meteor radar. The hourly winds were obtained at the height interval of 92-95 km using meteor radars with no angle gauges. The data were recorded at Molodezhnaya (Antarctica), Heiss Island (Arctic Ocean), Obninsk, USSR, and Khulungsborn, Germany. Radar characteristics include wave length = 9m, peak power = 50-70 kw, pulse length = 20-30 mks, pulse repetition = 500 pps, sensitivity = 2-3 mkv, 5-elements yagi antennae, and beam width = 35 degrees. The data coverage for the 4 stations spans 5 years. The term 'meteor wind' is used for the mesosphere wind estimates derived from meteor trail drifts measurements. Ionized meteor trails are produced by meteoroids (meteor particles) which enter the Earth's atmosphere. A meteor trail moves in the atmosphere due to the neutral wind and magnetic field. The radial component of this movement is measured using meteor radar. Estimates of 'meteor wind' are derived from the set of measurements of radial components using statistical characteristics of meteor parameter distributions and parameters of antenna pattern. The 'hourly meteor rate' which is the number of registered meteors for which reliable estimates of radial components can be obtained can also be determined. Meteoroids occur in the height interval 80-100 km and are centered at 92-95 km (maximum for the apex time, near 6 a.m. LT, and minimum for anti-apex time, near 6 p.m. LT )..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Subsample Grain Size Analysis - Expedition Database. ABSTRACT: This dataset consists of grain size analysis conducted by the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) Sedimentology Laboratory on subsamples taken from all types of samples collected as part of research cruises conducted by, or for, the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) and the results are archived in the GSCA GSCP Expedition Database. The analyses are typically conducted at either full, half or quarter phi intervals. Summary statistics include percentages of gravel, sand, silt, clay and mud as well as mean, kurtosis, skewness and standard deviation.Grain size is a fundamental means of characterizing seabed sediment. Seabed sediment may be named according to its grain size. Grain size analysis of marine sediment samples?is a valuable method of determining: the source of the sediments (i.e. whether they were derived from land and blown out to sea; whether they were deposited by oceanic currents or delivered by glaciers or icebergs); the energy level at the seabed under modern conditions (e.g. is?it quiet enough for fine-grained sediments to be deposited or are fines winnowed away,?leaving only coarser-grained sands and gravels behind?); the energy level?in the past when sediments below the seabed were deposited, based on down-core analysis of grain-size; the strength and stability properties of the sediments and their response to loading. Sands, clays and silts all behave very differently under loads. Even a small amount of fines can make a sediment unstable. So grain size is a crucial part of doing a geotechnical investigation of soil stability. The same applies for assessing the stability of a slope under wave-, or sediment- or seismic- loading; the potential for pollutants or contaminants to be deposited or transported; determining whether sediments will be eroded and or transported under the effects of bottom currents that may be produced during tidal fluctuations or severe winter storms.

TITLE: Microalgal Diversity at Antarctica. ABSTRACT: The major objectives of this project are as follows: 1. To document the biodiversity of microalgae at Antarctica 2. To investigate impacts such as global warming, increased UV radiation and nutrient enrichment on the physiological adaptation of Antarctic microalgae, in comparison with tropical and temperate collections. This is done by: 1. conducting an ecological survey of microalgal distribution at specific sites at Antarctica, especially those impacted by human activities. 2. isolating and purifying microalgae collected from Antarctica. 3. identifying the microalgal isolates based on morphological (light and electron microscopy), biochemical (pigments and fatty acids) and molecular (gene sequences) characteristics. 4. investigating the physiological adaptation of Antarctic microalgae under extreme environments, especially in relation to the impacts of global warming, increased UV radiation and nutrient enrichment, in comparison with tropical and temperate species. The principal milestones of the project are as follows: 1. Database of microalgal distribution at specific sites in Antarctica. 2. Establishment of cultures of mircoalgae from Antarctica. 3. Completion of characterization and identification of Antarctic microalgae. 4. Completion of the studies on the physiological adaptation of selected Antarctic microalgae, in comparison with tropical and temperate collections. In collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) we have gone on several expeditions to Casey, Antarctica. A collection of Antarctic microalgae has been established and is deposited in the University of Malaya Algae Culture Collection (UMACC). Comparative studies on the response of Antarctic, Tropical and Temperate microalgae to temperature and UVR stress are being conducted. Molecular basis of the adaptive mechanisms of the microalgae are also being investigated. In addition, the biochemical characterization of oxidative stress enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) is in progress. The data set consists of the species list of Antarctic microalgae in our collection, and the effect of temperature and UVR on the growth and fatty acid profiles of selected Antarctic microalgae..

TITLE: Canadian National and Regional Standardized Annual Precipitation Departures, in CDIAC, Trends '93. ABSTRACT: The Canadian precipitation departures series were prepared from data contained in the Historical Canadian Climate Database (HCCD). The HCCD contains a collection of total precipitation data sets (rainfall and snow water equivalent) for 131 reporting stations across Canada. Beginning in 1948, approximately 90% of the 131 precipitation reporting stations were used. Before 1915, fewer than 40% of the stations had precipitation data, and before 1948 most of Northern Canada was not represented. Some southern regions have suitable coverage from 1895 onward. Time series of standardized annual precipitation departures from the 1951-80 reference period averages were prepared for the 131 individual stations in the HCCD. The precipitation data are for national Canada and the following regions: Canada (1948-1992) Atlantic Canada (1895-1992) Great Lakes Basin St. Lawrence Lowlands (1895-1992) Northeastern Forest (1938-1992) Northwestern Forest (1932-1992) Prairies (1895-1992) South British Columbia Mountains (1895-1992) Pacific Coast (1911-1992) Yukon North British Columbia Mountains (1939-1992) Mackenzie District (1928-1992) Arctic Tundra (1948-1992) Arctic Mountains and Fiords (1948-1992) The citation for this dataset is: Findlay, B.F., D.W.

TITLE: Meltpond2000 Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer Sea Ice Brightness Temperatures. ABSTRACT: The Meltpond2000 project was the first in a series of Arctic and Antarctic aircraft campaigns to validate sea ice algorithms developed for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), primarily to quantify errors in AMSR-E sea ice products resulting from the presence of melt ponds. The AMSR-E validation effort addresses data quality through comprehensive calibration and validation programs. These programs characterize and document the accuracy and precision of AMSR-E observations and their derived products. Data were collected from five flights over Baffin Bay and the Canadian Archipelago from 26 June 2000 to 6 July 2000. All measurements fall within 68.967 deg N - 76.422 deg N, 63.197 deg W - 105.022 deg W. Spatial resolution varies from 0.13 km to 3.6 km, depending on the sensor.

TITLE: Arctic Ice Dynamics Experiment (AIDJEX) (1975-1976). ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: During the Summer of 1975 the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) maintained four manned camps on ice floes in the Arctic Ocean. Instrumentation located at those camps, or deployed on floating data buoys, recorded surface and geostrophic winds, ocean current velocity at 2 and 30 meter depths, and camp (ice floe) position. Data are archived as daily average values for each camp, as well as ice velocity and smoothed positions. Surface pressure and geostrophic wind data are also available at 6-hourly intervals. From April 7th through 10th, 1976 the submarine USS Gurnard participated in the AIDJEX by tranversing 777 nautical miles along three track lines in the Beaufort Sea, collecting ice thickness data from upward-looking acoustical soundings (sonar). The resulting digital data set is a profile of the sea ice layer, including latitude longitude, 'ping' interval, surface beam diameter, number of data points, and ice thickness. The termination of the AIDJEX project also signals the end of the AIDJEX databank. All validated source data have been submitted to national data banks for permanent retention, together with pertinent documentation. Copies will be distributed from those facilities upon the request of interested scientists. The data acquired during the AIDJEX main experiment have been validated, for the most part, by the principal investigators and analysts. Copies of finished data sets had been supplied to the data bank in several forms, such as unformatted binary using Fortran or Extended Fortran and in formatted SCOPE Internal Display code. Each set is in the format preferred by the analysts' that created it. The units of common variables also vary with the analysts' preference--for example, time in minutes of the day, dates as year-days of AIDJEX days (starting 1 January 1975), latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, and position in rectangular coordinates originating at the North Pole. Data presented to national data banks whose computer centers are not compatible with the CDC 6400 have been prepared in fixed block record size, external BCD,or even parity. Documentation is included as part of the headers and data records. Narrative descriptions of the data may be included as part of the header. PURPOSE: To make a wide range of climatic data available to researchers and the public.

TITLE: Global Precise GPS Satellite Ephemerides. ABSTRACT: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite ephemerides are computed from the data collected at the Canadian Active Control Point (ACP) stations. This data is augmented by up to 44 globally distributed stations of the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS). The GPS satellite ephemerides are typically available within 3 to 6 days following the observations. The ephemerides are provided as daily files (0:00 to 23:45 GPS Time) in the internationally accepted NGS-SP3 format which contains X, Y, Z satellite positions and clock corrections at 15-minute intervals. The files are available in the NAD83(CSRS) reference frame as well as in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).Used with the GPSPACE GPS point positioning program and the GPS Satellite Clock Corrections to provide DGPS accuracies without requiring base station data. Also, using the precise ephemerides in GPS processing will reduce all orbit related errors in GPS baseline determinations to less than 0.1 ppm.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Binned 4 KM Daily Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  Each Aqua MODIS Level-3 binned (4 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a season, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells have a resolution of 4.6x4.6km.

TITLE: Elevation Change of the Southern Greenland Ice Sheet from 1978-88. ABSTRACT: Southern Greenland ice sheet elevation change estimates are derived from SEASAT and GEOSAT radar altimetry data from 1978 to 1988. Data are confined to 61-72 deg N, 30-50 deg W, above 1700 m elevation. The addition of GEOSAT Geodetic Mission (GM) data results in twice as many crossover points and 50% greater coverage than previous studies. Coverage above 2000 m elevation is improved to 90%, and about 75% of the area between 1700 m and 2000 m is now covered. Data are in ASCII text format, available via FTP, and consist of elevation change rate (dH dt, cm year) and corresponding error estimates in 50 km grid cells..

TITLE: Alaska PaleoGlacier Atlas: A Geospatial Compilation of Pleistocene Glacier Extents. ABSTRACT: Three decades after the last Alaska-wide compilations of glacial geology (Karlstrom et al., 1964; Coulter et al., 1965), we have coordinated a broadly collaborative effort to create a digital map of reconstructed Pleistocene glaciers. The Alaska PaleoGlacier Atlas is a geospatial summary of Pleistocene glaciation across Alaska. The layers in the atlas depict: 1) the extent of glaciers during the late Wisconsin glaciation (i.e. Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago), and 2) the maximum extent reached during the last ca. 3 million years by the northwestern Cordilleran Ice Sheet, ice caps, and valley glaciers. The atlas is targeted for a scale of 1 to 1,000,000 -- suitable for visualization and regional analyses. Former glacier extents are based on decades of field-based mapping, air-photo interpretation, and a variety of dating methods. In all, the first version combines glacial-geologic information from 26 publications and 42 source maps. Revisions will be made and released as time and resources allow. A companion paper (Kaufman and Manley, subm.; part of an INQUA effort for a global atlas with regional reviews) summarizes the glacial-geologic evidence and highlights recent revisions, remaining uncertainties, and implications for paleoclimate forcing.

TITLE: Permafrost Map of Alaska, USA. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of a geo-referenced digital map and attribute data derived from the publication 'Permafrost map of Alaska'. The map is presented at a scale of 1 to 2,500,000 and shows the correlation of physiographic province to presence of permafrost across the state of Alaska. The digital data were prepared under the U.S. Geological Survey Global Change Program, Land Data Systems - Arctic Land Processes Studies for display and analysis of terrain. The line work was captured by hand digitizing the source map, Ferrians, O.J., 1965, Permafrost map of Alaska - U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geologic Investigations Map I-445. Scale 1 to 2,500,000. The digital map was assembled and edited in ARC INFO. The source map projection is polyconic. It is based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid with a central meridian of 150 W longitude. The data were geo-referenced from digitizer coordinates to the polyconic projection and then projected into an Albers Equal Area projection. The coastline was taken from the U.S Geological Survey, 1 to 2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987). Attributes for the permafrost map were assigned. Metadata documentation was completed in 1996. The map units are closed polygons that are generalized in shape and size. They are defined in terms of their physiographic characteristics and association with permafrost. Each unit differs with respect to all other units and is uniquely identified as follows. 11 Mountainous Area underlain by continuous permafrost 12 Mountainous Area underlain by discontinuous permafrost 13 Mountainous Area underlain by isolated masses of permafrost 21 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by thick permafrost 22 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by moderately thick to thin permafrost 23 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by discontinuous permafrost 24 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by numerous isolated masses of permafrost 25 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by isolated masses of permafrost 26 Lowland and Upland Area generally free of permafrost Use constraints - The U.S. Geological Survey should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The data are general in nature and should not be used at a scale larger than 1 to 2,500,000, that of the original map. Users must assume responsibility to determine the usability of this data for their purposes. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated and users are responsible for obtaining the latest revisions of the data. Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the U.S. Geological Survey, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the agency regarding the utility of the data on any other system, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty. A copy of this map is presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998..

TITLE: Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM I Passive Microwave Data. ABSTRACT: The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) sea ice concentration data set in the polar stereographic projection is derived from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) data using the NASA Team algorithm. It is designed to provide a consistent time series of sea ice concentrations (the fraction of ocean area covered by sea ice) spanning the coverage of several passive microwave instruments. To aid in this goal, sea ice algorithm coefficients are changed to reduce differences in sea ice extent and area as estimated using the SMMR and SSM I sensors. The data set currently includes daily and monthly averaged sea ice concentrations derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP-F8, -F11 and -F13 SSM I daily brightness temperatures at a grid cell size of 25 x 25 km. The data set begins October 1978 and continues through December 2004. Data are available via FTP. Data files are stored as flat binary data with one byte per pixel. For each data file, a corresponding graphics file in GIF format is provided. These sea ice concentrations are generated by the Oceans and Ice Branch, Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes at NASA GSFC, using SMMR brightness temperatures that were processed at NASA GSFC and SSM I brightness temperatures that were processed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Both of these data sets are archived at NSIDC..

TITLE: National Ice Center Arctic Sea Ice Charts and Climatologies in Gridded Format. ABSTRACT: The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is an inter-agency sea ice analysis and forecasting center comprised of Dept. of Commerce NOAA, Dept. of Defense U.S. Navy, and Dept. of Homeland Security U.S. Coast Guard components. Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is an Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2004, and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for 33 year, 10 year, and 5 year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in 25 km EASE-Grid (gridded binary). Ice extent can be derived from concentration by summing the number of equal area EASE-Grid cells. GIF browse files are also provided. The climatologies are also made available in a Geographical Information System (GIS) compatible format. NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references in the documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series..

TITLE: Cosmogenic Radionuclide in Ice Cores. ABSTRACT: This project is intended to provide a record of cosmogenic radionuclides, 10Be (half-life = 1.5 Myr) and 36Cl (0.30 Myr), concentrations in the Siple Dome ice cores. It is particularly instructive to compare the Antarctic record with the detailed Arctic record that we are measuring as part of the GISP2 project. We cut annual samples of the "A" core from the surface to 48 m corresponding to the years 1995 AD to 1698 AD. The 10Be measurements have been nearly completed. The 36Cl chemistry was completed at Berkeley. AMS 36Cl measurements and Cl concentration measurements at LLNL are still unfinished. Below 54 m, we coordinated our sample collection with the continuous ion measurements. Although we received more than 800 melt water samples, more than 25% of these samples were not suitable for our work, either because of partial loss of solution during transport, unclear depth information, or because the sample mass was too small. We have selected over 600 samples, including some uncertainties of sample documentation that cover less than 75% of total depth of core. Presently, chemical separation and purification of Be and Cl for all samples has been completed. 10Be AMS measurements are also nearly completed. Although Cl sample preparation has been completed, about 90% of the 36Cl measurements and Cl concentration measurements at LLNL need to be performed. Thus, the data are still preliminary and fragmental. Each melted ice sample was passed through a 30 µm Millipore filters before chemical separation of Be and Cl. A photograph of each filter was taken and digitized for archival storage. These digitized pictures will be available for distribution to other investigators. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. OPP-0126343..

TITLE: Characteristics of Preferred Foraging and Nesting for Tundra-Breeding Shorebirds. ABSTRACT: Purpose: Data from this project will be used to identify the most valuable habitats and regions for shorebirds, guide development activities, and estimate population size in areas of special interest. Abstract: The North Slope of Alaska is currently the scene of intensive oil exploration activities. Wells have been drilled recently in several previously untouched areas, and more activity is expected. The region is renowned for its shorebird populations, yet little quantitative data are available at present to help guide development or provide a baseline for determining effects of these activities during the coming decades. This project will involve habitat delineation using geographic-information-system techniques and then ground surveys to count breeding shorebirds in each habitat. Methodology: Wells have been drilled recently in several previously untouched areas, and more activity is expected..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Standard Mapped Product Suite. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color, photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html SeaWiFS acquires approximately 15 pole-to-pole orbital swaths of data per day, and approximately 90% of the ocean surface is scanned every two days. Visible and near infrared raw radiance counts are collected (Level 1A data) and are converted to geophysical parameters (Level 2 data). Level 3 (9 km) data processing involves both temporal and spatial binning and utilizes Level 2 Global Area Coverage (GAC) (4 km) data as input. The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection (and 4 km for NDVI products). The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Other SMI products: -SeaWiFS Level 3 PAR refers to false-colored images of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) from the sun 400-700 nm. For additional information about the PAR algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf -SeaWiFS NDVI refers to images of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - an indicator of chlorophyll distributions on land (NDVI) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Global Paleogeographic Views of Earth History - Late Precambrian to Recent. ABSTRACT: [From Global Paleogeographic Views of Earth History - Late Precambrian to Recent, by Ronald C. Blakey, "http:  jan.ucc.nau.edu ~rcb7 globaltext2.html"] The globes presented in this series show how Earth may have appeared over the last 600 million years (Ma). The global views were prepared from rectangular projections drawn at a resolution of 3000x1500 pixels for each of the 26 time slices (small files of the rectangular maps are also included). Topography was "cloned" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The modern Earth was also drawn in this manner using a color pallet derived from satellite images created by ARC Science of Loveland, Colorado. The geologic data was gathered from the references listed below. The completed rectangular images were then wrapped on a sphere and saved as jpg files..

TITLE: Dissolved Al in the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: Sampling and Analytical Methodology: Samples were taken using 24 internally Teflon-coated PVC 12 litre GO-FLO Samplers (General Oceanics Inc.) mounted on an all-titanium frame. This frame was connected to a 17.7 mm diameter Kevlar hydrowire with seven independent internal signal conductor cables (Cousin Trestec S.A.) and controlled from onboard. Each GO-FLO sampler had a special ultraclean all-teflon PTFE valve (Cole Parmer; PN A-06392-31) installed. Samples for trace metal analysis were collected from the GO-FLO bottles in a class 100 clean room environment. The water was filtered over a 0.2 μm filter cartridge (Sartrobran-300, Sartorius) under pressure (1.5 atm) of (in-line prefiltered) nitrogen gas exerted via a special connector instead of the regular air bleeding valve at the top of each GO-FLO sampler. Sub-samples for Al were taken in cleaned LDPE sample bottles (125 mL) from each GO-FLO bottle. All sample bottles were rinsed five times with the sample seawater. Analyses of dissolved Al were based on a method developed by Resing and Measures (1994). Samples were stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) and analysed usually within 24 h after sampling but always within 36 h. Samples were acidified at least 1 h before analyses with 12 M ultraclean HCl (Baseline® Hydrochloric Acid, Seastar Chemicals Inc.) to a pH of 1.8. In a flow injection system the samples were buffered inline to a pH of 4.8 ± 0.1 with ultraclean 0.6 M ammonium acetate buffer. This buffer was produced by diluting a saturated solution of ammonium acetate crystals to an 0.6 M solution with MQ. The pH was subsequently adjusted to 6.7 with ultraclean ammonium hydroxide. This was produced by bubbling 0.2 µm filtered high purity ammonia gas through MQ water. The buffered sample was pre-concentrated for 240 s on a Toyopearl AF-Chelate 650M (TosoHaas, Germany) column. Hereafter the column was rinsed for 60 s with MQ water to remove interfering salts. The Al was subsequently eluted from the column with 0.16 M HCl (Suprapure, Merck) during 250 s. The eluate of Al in HCl entered the reaction stream which consisted of a lumogallion (Pfaltz & Bauer) solution in 4 M ammonium acetate buffer. The 4 M buffer was produced similar to the 0.6 M buffer (see above), but with the pH adjusted to 6.8 ± 0.1 and the lumogallion was a 4.8 mM solution in MQ. The mixing of the HCl and buffer results in a reaction pH of 5.7 ± 0.1 at which an Al-Lumogallion chelate complex is formed which can be detected by its fluorescence. The complex was mixed in a 10 m reaction coil placed in a water bath of 50 °C. Hereafter a 2.5% Brij-35 (Merck) solution in MQ was added to increase the sensitivity (Resing and Measures, 1994) and mixed in a 3 m mixing coil. Afterwards the emission of the fluorescent complex was detected on a FIA-lab PMT-FL detector with a 510 until 580 nm emission filter and a 480 until 490 nm excitation filter. Concentrations of Al were calculated in nanomol.L-1 from the peak heights. The system was calibrated using standard additions from a 5000 nM Al stock solution (Fluka) to filtered acidified seawater of low Al concentration that was collected in the Arctic Ocean. A six-point calibration line (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 nM standard additions) and blank determination were made every day. The 3 lowest points (0, 1 and 2 nM) of the calibration line were measured in triplicate and the 3 highest points (4, 8 and 16 nM) in duplicate in order to add more weight to the lower part of the calibration line. The blank was determined by plotting the signals of increasing pre-concentration times (30, 60, 120, 210 and 300 seconds) of the water also used for the calibration. A line was fitted through these data points and the intercept of the line taken as the blank, which was usually below 0.2 nM. If the blank was greater than 0.2 nM, the analysis run was stopped. Subsequently the system was cleaned and the blank reanalysed with freshly made sampling buffer until the blank value was below the 0.2 nM limit. The limit of detection, defined as three times the standard deviation of the lowest concentration observed, was 0.15 nM. The FIA system was cleaned every day by rinsing with a 0.5 M HCl solution. Data Processing: A standard was measured in triplicate every day. This standard was a sub-sample of a 25 L volume of filtered seawater that was taken at the beginning of the cruise in the Barents Sea. The relative standard deviation of the replicate analysis seawater sample that was analysed 27 times on different days in triplicate was 3.19%. The relative standard deviation on single days was on average 2%. The average Al concentration of this standard was 4.93 nM and the deviation from this average for a given measuring day was used as a correction factor. To verify whether this was decreasing the inter-daily variability in the dataset, every day a sample which was collected and measured the previous measuring day, was analysed once again. The deviation between the concentrations measured on the different days decreased from 3.6% to 2.8%, indicating the data correction is beneficial. Moreover, samples of the SAFe intercalibration program (Johnson et al., 2007) were analysed in triplicate (Table 1). It appears that the Al concentration in bottle S #252 is slightly higher than the concentration for surface (S) water found by Brown and Bruland (2008), but not statistically different. Bottle S #425 is in almost perfect agreement, as is bottle D2 #3 for deep (D2) water from 1000m. The dataset was scanned for obvious outliers and these have been quality flagged with the number 4. Some samples gave anomalous nutrient results for the intended depth and were assumed to have been closed at the wrong depth and quality flagged with the number 8. All other values are assumed to be correct and flagged with the number 0.

TITLE: NOAA HRPT Data Collected at Spitzbergen. ABSTRACT: The available dataset contains mainly NOAA-9 overpasses received by a mobile HRPT receiving station that was positioned at Spitzbergen (78.12N, 15.40E). Due to the high latitude, parts of up to 14 orbits were received per day. The coverage of 60-70 degrees north could not be achieved over the whole longitude range. Data are available on 6250 BPI tapes and include counts and histograms for AVHRR channels 1-5, calibration coefficients (slope and intercepts) for AVHRR channels 3-5, and undecoded TIP data. Not all data are of good quality. B W negative transparencies are generated for all overpasses collected, showing AVHRR channels 1,2,3, and 4; each pixel available may be resolved. Two overpasses per day, app. 0530Z and 1130Z, were calibrated and remapped onto a polar stereographic projection in the vicinity of Spitzbergen and B W transparencies were produced containing images of reflectivities in AVHRR channels 2 and 3 as well as temperatures in channel 4. These are published as a data report..

TITLE: Database of Benthic Macrofaunal Biomass and Productivity Measurements for the Eastern Canadian Continental Shelf, Slope and Adjacent Areas. ABSTRACT: Measurements of biomass and productivity of seabed macrobenthic and megabenthic organisms, from studies in eastern North America from New England to the Canadian Arctic dating from 1954 to 2000, have been assembled into a comprehensive, georeferenced, database. Information sources include primary publications, technical reports and unpublished data from scientific studies, commercial fisheries surveys, and monitoring and baseline studies carried out for offshore petroleum exploration. Supporting information and study synopses are also included. The database is compatible with existing electronic databases within Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and is intended to be made accessible via the internet. The current study has been carried out as part of an initiative to map biomass and productivity of benthic communities on the continental shelf of Eastern Canada, with a particular focus on relationships with surficial geology and depth, to support research initiatives within Fisheries and Oceans Canada dealing with ecosystems on the Scotian Shelf and Georges Bank. An additional objective, however, is to make the data accessible from the internet, as part of DFO&#039;s ongoing data collection and management activities..

TITLE: Into the Arctic -- Information and Educational Activities for Studying Climate. ABSTRACT: 'Into the Arctic' contains educational materials about climate and climate history in the Arctic that use real data and questions from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2). Beginning in 1993, scientists from all over the world participated in the GISP2 project to drill through 3,000 meters of ice in Greenland, and discovered a history of the world's climate. Inspired by the research results from GISP2, 'Into the Arctic' offers instructional materials and activities for teachers to use in the many contexts of their daily teaching routines. Its unique feature is that it provides data collected and used by research scientists, and it provides students with the questions scientists grapple with in their research. There are no right or wrong answers. Students are presented with the data, and they are free to suggest answers to the questions posed. Lessons and activities are designed for use by secondary through lower-level college students studying Earth science, geography, history, social studies or chemistry. Information and activities are divided into four sections: Climate, Climate Change, El Nino, and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2. The subjects selected range from the broad (Climate and Climate Change) to the more specific (El Nino and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) to provide the reader with background in Earth science that can then be applied using broadly related case studies..

TITLE: Nimbus-7 SMMR Derived Monthly Global Snow Cover and Snow Depth. ABSTRACT: The data set consists of monthly global snow cover and snow depth derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR data for 1978 through 1987. The SMMR data are interpolated for spatial and temporal gaps, and averaged for display in polar stereographic projection. Maps are based on six-day average brightness temperature data from the middle week of each month. Data are placed into 1 2 degree latitude by 1 2 degree longitude grid cells uniformly subdividing a polar stereographic map according to the geographic coordinates of the center of the radiometers' fields of view. Overlapping data from separate orbits in the same six-day period are averaged to give a single brightness temperature assumed to be at the cell's center. Oceans and bays are masked so that only microwave data for land areas are displayed. Comparisons of SMMR snow cover maps with previous maps produced by NOAA NESDIS and US Air Force Global Weather Center indicate that the total snow covered area derived from SMMR is usually about ten percent less than that measured by the earlier products, because passive microwave sensors often can't detect shallow dry snow less than about 5 cm deep. Snow depths are comparable, showing SMMR results to be especially good for uniform snow covered areas such as the Canadian high plains and Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous areas tend to mask the microwave snow signatures, and SMMR snow depth derivations are less reliable in those areas. Formerly distributed by NASA GSFC NSSDC and NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS), these data are now available via ftp from NSIDC..

TITLE: Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). ABSTRACT: The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program's primary objective is to test and improve General Circulation Model (GCM) parameterizations of clouds and their effect on the radiative energy balance. The ARM Program focuses on six research areas: 1) aerosols, 2) clouds, 3) longwave radiation, 4) shortwave radiation, 5) surface energy exchange (or flux), and 6) atmospheric state. Meteorology data from the North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site at Barrow, Alaska include wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, visibility, and precipitation for the atmospheric column above the site. Radiation measurements at the site include longwave and shortwave radiation, including infrared and solar radiation. Solar radiation data include total daily solar radiation, direct-beam normal irradiance, downwelling hemispheric diffuse irradiance, and downwelling hemispheric irradiance. Infrared radiation data include radiance spectra ensemble (1800-3020 cm-1 and 520-1800 cm-1), mean radiances for short- and longwave wavenumbers, downwelling hemispheric infrared irradiance, longwave scene radiance spectral averages (AERI Ch1), longwave scene variability spectral averages (AERI Ch1), and net radiation. Data are available at http:  www.arm.gov docs data.html . The ARM measurements are aggregated together in data files. A data file usually contains a time series of one or more measurements for a known time interval and a single location. Most data are stored in netCDF format. Some data files also contain one or more measurements distributed over a region from a single time (e.g., satellite images); these data are stored in HDF format..

TITLE: Antarctic Surface Temperature and Pressure Data, CDIAC NDP-032. ABSTRACT: This package contains monthly-mean surface temperature and station or sea-level pressure data for 29 meteorological stations on Antarctica. Of these 29 stations, 18 are considered to be primary stations. At four of the stations in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Faraday, Bellinghausen, Esperenza, and Rothera Point), data records from neighboring sites with records of short duration were merged into single station records. The first version of this database was compiled at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom. The database extended through 1988 and was made available in 1989 by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) as a Numeric Data Package (NDP), NDP-032. This update of the database includes data through early 1999 for most stations (through 2000 for a few), and also includes all available mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature data. For many stations this means that over 40 years of data are now available, enough for many of the trends associated with recent warming to be more thoroughly examined. These temperature and pressure data were assembled primarily from the World Weather Records (WWR) and Monthly Climatic Data for the World (MCDW) volumes for 1951-1960 and 1961-1970. Data records from these sources were supplemented with data from additional sources described in the package. All the assembled data were checked for quality and long-term homogeneity using inter-station comparison techniques. The assessment of the long-term homogeneity of the records was done by comparing the records of two or three neighboring stations. Due to the distances between the stations, this assessment could only be adequately done for stations in the Antarctic Peninsula region and along the main coast of the continental area. Those stations outside these regions were checked only for major errors. Greater details about the inter-station comparison technique are provided in Jones and Limbert (1987). All CDIAC numerical data packages include copies of pertinent literature discussing the data, summaries discussing the background, source and scope of the data, as well as applications limitations and restrictions of the data. More information on this data set can be found at: "http:  cdiac.esd.ornl.gov epubs ndp ndp032 ndp032.html".

TITLE: Barrow Area Information Database (BAID) Geospatial Data Sets, Barrow, AK, USA. ABSTRACT: This data collection is comprised of geospatial data for the Barrow, Alaska, USA, region. These data were compiled by Nuna Technologies and Arctic Ecology Lab at Michigan State University under contract to the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC) to facilitate research in the Barrow area. The collection is termed the Barrow Area Information Database (BAID). Data currently available include imagery (aerial photographs, Landsat), and shapefiles showing locations of administrative units (adjacent federal lands, village districts, zoning, tax parcels, and the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation boundary), and research sites (the NOAA-CMDL clean air sector). Metadata meeting Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) standards accompany each data set. These data may be viewed in the BAID-Internet Map Server (BAID-IMS), a project developed under the Barrow Area Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) initiative, coordinated by the Digital Working Group (DWG) of the BASC. This project was funded as part of the SDI effort. The BASC received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF Award OPP-0004401: Supplemental Request for the BAID-IMS Prototype) and the US Geological Survey (USGS Award Number 03HQAG0177: Don't Duck Metadata - Metadata Outreach). This collection will be expanded as metadata are documented for additional data sets. Other data that will be available in shapefile format include other administrative boundaries, geodetic control points, topography, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), hydrography, vegetation, soils, permafrost, biologic data (nesting sites, migration routes), infrastructure (pipelines, roads, buildings, telecommunications) as well as other historic and extant research study areas (for example, sampling points, bore holes, transects)..

TITLE: Canadian Intersite Decomposition Experiment. ABSTRACT: Several projects are underway to quantitatively model the current and potential changes in the carbon budgets of Canadian forests due to climate change. Information is limited for many of the processes being modeled, particularly those related to soil processes. Of major importance is the rate of litter decomposition which is lacking in extent and length for most forest ecosystems. To overcome this data deficiency, a group of researchers from across Canada has been assembled to conduct a long-term decomposition experiment. The Canadian Intersite Decomposition Experiment (CIDET), is a cooperative study by 20 researchers from the Canadian Forest Service, universities and provincial ministries, with a main objective to investigate the long-term rates of litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization over a broad range of forested ecoclimatic regions in Canada. The study, established in 1992, involves the preparation of almost 11,000 litter bags containing samples of 12 standard litter types. Ten sets were then placed in each of four replicate plots on 21 sites (18 upland and 3 wetland) representing a range of forested ecoclimatic regions. Each year for ten years, one set of bags is removed per plot and analyzed for weight loss and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content. Regression techniques will be used to establish the relationship between decay rates, substrate quality and climate, the second main objective of the experiment. The final three objectives of the experiment will be addressed through the use of subsets of samples and data to test for the relative importance of site factors and microclimate on decay rates; test for the influence of site moisture regimes on decay rates; test specific hypotheses on the observed pattern of litter decomposition. In addition to the 23 litter types characterized for nutrient content and organic C fractions as part of CIDET, 14 other litter types have been characterized as part of an NSERC funded study and the complete set of chemical data from both studies has been published. Analysis of all litter types and characterization of the chemical proximate fractions of selected litter types is continuing. Research results on measures of litter quality, a comparison of third year results, controls on litter decomposition and effects of climate change are available through the network resource site. The successful establishment of CIDET complements similar studies underway in the United States and Europe. Together these studies will increase our understanding of the relationship between climate, litter quality and decay processes. Proponents of the U.S. study have expressed interest in using CIDET results for testing models presently under development and methods will be compared with a long-term study being conducted in Edinburgh, U.K.To provide data on the long-term rates on litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization for a range of forested ecoclimatic regions in Canada.

TITLE: Samples from 2007 for the COPOL project. ABSTRACT: COPOL is a project under the auspices of the International Polar Year (IPY). The main objective of the project is to understand the dynamic range of man-made contaminants in marine ecosystems of Polar Regions, in order to better predict how possible future climate change will be reflected in levels and effects at higher trophic levels. This aim will be addressed by 4 integrated work packages covering the scopes of 1) food web contaminant exposure and flux, 2) transfer to higher trophic levels and potential effects, 3) chemical analyses and screening, 4) synthesis and integration. The COPOL project focuses on the Arctic region, and the main effort is concentrated in Kongsfjorden (Spitzbergen). This fjord has been identified as particularly suitable as a study site of contaminants processes, due to the remoteness of sources, and for influences of climatic changes, due to the documented relation between Atlantic water influx and the climatic index North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Variable Atlantic water influx will not only influence abiotic contaminant exposure, but also food web structure, food quality and energy pathways, as different water masses carry different phyto- and zooplankton assemblages. This may affect the flux of contaminants through the food web to high trophic level predators such as seabirds and seals, due to altered food quality and energy pathways. Three field campaigns were conducted in 2007 (spring, summer and autumn), collecting sea water, sediments, and organisms ranging from plankton and benthic invertebrates, to fish and sea birds. Field campaigns are also scheduled for the summer of 2008 and 2009..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Weekly Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Canadian Peatland Database. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Peatland Database contains information on the nature and distribution of peatland in Canada. There is an estimated 154 GT of carbon in Canadian peatlands, 95% of which is found in boreal, subarctic, and arctic areas (Tarnocai, 1998). Sixty percent of the area of Canadian peatlands is expected to be severely, to extremely severely, affected by climate warming caused by a doubling of CO2 (Kettles and Tarnocai, 2000). The work is on-going and accessible on-line. It is also available from the Geological Survey of Canada as Geological Survey of Canada Open File 3834. The Open File includes a 1 6.5 million-scale map using the database.The Canadian Peatland Database will serve as baseline data for monitoring the effects of climate change on peatland and its impact on the Canadian environment.

TITLE: Modeled Carbon Responses of Tundra Ecosystems to Historical and Projected Climate. ABSTRACT: This data set contains the model output data of Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) simulations from 1920-2100 for both moist tundra and polar desert alpine tundra for the Pan-arctic, compared to output for the Kuparuk River Basin (moist tundra). TEM simulates C and N fluxes and pools. 5,942 grid cells were used in the Pan-arctic simulation, of which 3,614 were considered polar desert alpine tundra and 2,328 were considered moist tundra. All 19 grid cells in the Kuparuk simulation were considered moist tundra. The values of several ecosystem variables are compared between the Pan-arctic and Kuparuk. The results of this study are presented and discussed in McGuire et al. (2000), Modeling carbon responses of tundra ecosystems to historical and projected climate: sensitivity of Pan-arctic carbon storage to temporal and spatial variation in climate. Global Change Biology 6: 141-159. The simulations use the moist tundra and polar desert alpine tundra calibrations developed by McGuire et al. (1992), based on data from Toolik Lake, Alaska..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Cloud Mask and Spectral Test Results 5-Min L2 Swath 250m and 1km (Collection 004 and 005). ABSTRACT: MODIS was launched aboard the Aqua satellite on May 4, 2002 (1:30 pm equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands), and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at NASA Goddard DAAC and has been made available to public since April 2000. The MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime & nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel ( paulm@ssec.wisc.edu). MYD35_L2 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Each of the 9 gridded parameters is stored as a Scientific Data Set (SDS) within the HDF-EOS file. The Cloud Mask and Quality Assurance SDS's are stored at 1 kilometer pixel resolution. All other SDS's (those relating to time, geolocation, and viewing geometry) are stored at 5 kilometer pixel resolution. Each file is roughly 47.5 MB in size, and the total data volume is approximately 13.7 GB day. For browsing and extracting data from these files, some software are made available at the site.

TITLE: East Siberian Air, Ground Temperature, and Snow Depth Measurements, 1882-1994. ABSTRACT: This data set contains historical data for 35 Russian stations located between approximately 117-145 E and 55-72 N. Data were collected between 1882-1994, but the time period covered by each station and the parameters measured are variable. Daily measurements of snow depth were taken from three snow measuring rods placed in a meteorological enclosure. In individual cases, when the meteorological enclosure was unrepresentative of the surroundings in respect to snow cover formation, the snow measuring rods were placed near the station on a specially selected plot. The daily mean was calculated by averaging the readings from the three rods, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter. If the average was less than 0.5 cm, the mean was considered zero, and if it was greater than or equal to 0.5 cm, it was considered 1 cm. If snow, ice, or melt water was absent at one of the rods, the mean depth was calculated by dividing the sum of the readings by three. The daily data were then averaged at the end of a ten-day period into a single value. This averaging was done three times per month, with the final period in the month containing from eight to 11 days of data, depending on the month. Air and ground temperature measurements were taken with mercury thermometers with high inertiality. Measurements were taken as part of the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions - Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System (LAII-ATLAS) program. The research project was funded by the Arctic System Sciences (ARCSS) Program, grant numbers OPP-9721347 and OPP-9732126..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Monthly Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: ERS-1 Ice Motion Vector Data. ABSTRACT: ERS-1 Ice Motion Vector Data is generated from pairs of geocoded low resolution SAR imagery. The time separation between the repeat viewing of the same ice field depends on the orbit characteristics of the ERS-1 platform and the geographic location of the region of interest. Typical values are between 3 and 35 days. The absolute spatial displacement of ice features is measured and reported for every cell of the 5km SSM I grid covered by the selected pair of images. Since each ERS-1 SAR image covers an 100x100 km area, each ice motion vector product covers approximately the same area. Individual data products are very small (about 30 KBytes) and are available electronically as well as on 9-track or 8 mm tape. The data is presented in CEOS format. Approval by NASA is required to obtain the data. Please contact ASF user services to become a NASA approved investigator..

TITLE: Penny Ice Cap Microparticle Data. ABSTRACT: Penny Ice Cap ice core and snowpit microparticle data. This dataset contains a summary of microparticle measurements from snowpits and a 334-m long ice core (P95) from the Penny Ice Cap, Baffin Island, Canada. Snowpits were excavated in 1994-1995, and core P95 was drilled in April-May 1995. The P95 core was dated back to 7900 yr ago (319 m) by spectral analysis of the electrical conductivity record which tracks seasonal chemical variations (Fisher et al. 1998; Grumet et al., 1998. Additional time control was provided by conductivity and sulfate peaks related major volcanic eruptions. Beyond 7900 yr ago, the depth-age curve was adjusted to match the end of the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition (326 m) dated at 11,550 + - 70 yr ago in Greenland ice-core records. Age values for the P95 microparticle record are expressed in years before A.D. 2000 (yb2k). Microparticle concentrations and size distributions were measured for a size range of 0.85 to 12 µm with an Elzone 280PC multi-channel particle counter equipped with a 30 µm orifice (Zdanowicz et al., 1998). The microparticle parameters are: N = total number of particles [0.85-12 µm], expressed in thousands of particles per mililiter of meltwater (10^3 ml^-1) M = total mass of particles [0.85-12 µm], expressed in micrograms per kilogram of ice (µg kg^-1 or ppb) NMD = arithmetic mean diameter of microparticles [0.85-12 µm], in micrometers (µm) b (beta) = slope of a Junge distribution applied to microparticles with diameter < 1 µm.

TITLE: Sea Surface Temperature Images from ATSR (ERS) and AVHRR (NOAA) data from the Tromso Satellite Station (TSS). ABSTRACT: Under an ESA contract, TSS receives global ATSR data from the ERS-1 satellite. This is a demonstration project where data is processed in Tromso and the products are distributed directly to the end user. The UK Met. Office is one of the users having received ATSR data products from TSS. This near real-time service is set up using Internet for transmission of the products. The operational service aquires an average of 10 ERS-1 passes a day, every day throughout the year. Through this near real-time demonstration project, the TSS infrastructure has proven to be very well suited for supporting an operational service with useful and necessary information. A full resolution ATSR data product chain has also been implemented very recently. TSS can now offer in near-real time full resolution (1 km) brightness and sea surface temperature products. The coverage is global for the ATSR, and for the AVHRR the coverage is that of TSS (i.e., Northern Europe)..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Weekly Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Near-Real-Time DMSP SSM I Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations. ABSTRACT: This data set provides a near-real-time (NRT) map of sea ice concentrations for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The near-real-time passive microwave brightness temperature data are acquired with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) on board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F17 satellite. The SSMIS instrument is the next generation Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) instrument. SSMIS data are received daily from the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are gridded onto a polar stereographic grid. Investigators generate sea ice concentrations from these data using the NASA Team algorithm. These data are stored as one-byte flat scaled binary arrays with one byte per pixel, at a resolution of 25 km. For each data file, a corresponding PNG image file is provided. These data are available via FTP for the most recent three to six months and are retained on the FTP site until NSIDC's Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM I Passive Microwave Data (preliminary data) become available for the same time period. These data are primarily meant to provide a best estimate of current ice and snow conditions based on information and algorithms available at the time the data are acquired. Near-real-time products are not intended for operational use in assessing sea ice conditions for navigation and should be used with caution in extending the sea ice time series in NSIDC's Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM I Passive Microwave Data..

TITLE: Arctic soft-sediment macrobenthos (EUROBIS). ABSTRACT: Samples of the macrobenthic fauna of soft sediments were collected from around Svalbard during the 1991 Arctic EPOS cruise of RVPolarstern. Although faunal variability could be related to sediment granulometry and depth, all stations to the south and east of the Archipelago lay within the broadly defined central Barents Sea community. In this community, (alfa-diversity was variable and sampled between 77 and 337 m showed no clear relationship to depth. Diversity in the area close to the polar front was notably high, rarefaction predicting that 43 ± 5.5 species might occur in a sample of 201 individuals. k-Dominance plots suggested that muddy sand communities around Sval- bard were no less diverse than similar assemblages in the North Sea.

TITLE: ANSCIA Barrow Ground Control Point Database. ABSTRACT: This series of web pages presents site information for 63 Ground Control Points (GCP's) measured near Barrow, Alaska, during the summer of 2001 using Differential GPS. The GCP's were measured on the corners of buildings, ends of snowfences, base of telephone poles, and other features visible on small- to large-scale imagery. They are concentrated generally within 2 km of the Chukchi coast (coinciding with extent of the year 2000 air photos). The GCP's will help researchers and other scientists working in the area to establish precise geographic or UTM coordinates for field sites, and to assist with georectification of aerial photography and satellite imagery. The GCP's were measured as part of an ongoing research project, Alaska North Slope Climate Impact Assessment (ANSCIA), which is funded by the National Science Foundation's program on Human Dimensions of the Arctic System. This database is being made publicly available as part of our objectives for data sharing and outreach to both the scientific community and the public at large.

TITLE: Laboratory Studies of Photochemistry in Antarctic Snow and Ice. ABSTRACT: Our US NSF-funded project had two major parts: (1) measuring the quantum yields for photolysis of nitrite (NO2-), nitrous acid (HNO2), and hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) using laboratory ices, and (2) measuring the wavelength-dependent light absorption by soluble species in snow samples from Dome Concordia and Summit, Greenland. The laboratory photolysis work is not included in this database but can be found in publications cited in the reference section of this metadata. The second part of our work (the measurements of light absorption by soluble snow chemical species) is included in this database and was recently submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research (C. Anastasio and T. Robles, Light absorption by soluble chemical species in Arctic and Antarctic snow). This work is summarized below. Using a liquid core waveguide spectrophotometer we have quantified the very low light absorbance of dissolved chromophores (light absorbing species) in filtered samples of melted polar snows. Light absorption coefficients at 280 nm span the ranges of 0.005 - 0.029 m^-1 and 0.002 - 0.037 m^-1 for samples from Summit, Greenland and Dome Concordia, Antarctica, respectively. Absorption coefficients decrease with increasing wavelength and also decrease with increasing depth in the snow pack. At both sites nitrate (NO3-) and HOOH together account for approximately half of the summed light absorption coefficients for wavelengths of 280 nm and above; the remaining ~ 50% of light absorbance is due to unknown, probably organic, chromophores. Based on our light absorption measurements and modeled actinic fluxes, we calculate that the rates of sunlight absorption by soluble chromophores in surface snows are approximately (1 - 4) 10^11 and (3 - 10) 10^11 photons cm^-3 s^-1 during summer at Summit and Dome C, respectively. Approximately 50 - 90% of this sunlight absorption is due to unknown chromophores, while the remainder is due to hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. Although we do not know quantum yields for the photochemical reactions of the unknown chromophores, their large contribution to the rate of sunlight absorption suggests that they play an important role in the photochemistry of polar snowpacks..

TITLE: Aerosol Optical Depth Measurements from Four NOAA CMDL Monitoring Sites, in CDIAC, Trends '93. ABSTRACT: Measurements of direct solar irradiance have been carried out since 1977 at each of four baseline atmospheric monitoring stations operated by NOAA CMDL. The four stations are at: Barrow, Alaska (1977-1992) Mauna Loa, Hawaii (1977-1992) Samoa, Cape Matatula (1977-1992) South Pole, Antarctica (1977-1992) Monitoring is done by means of a wideband pyrheliometer. Measured values are compared with results of solar irradiance calculations to derive aerosol optical depth (AOD), defined as the aerosol component of the exponent in the exponential decrease in solar beam intensity as the beam passes through the atmosphere. The data are presented as monthly anomalies in relation to a baseline comprised of all AOD values from the nonvolcanic years at a given site, with mean seasonal variation removed.

TITLE: Marbled Murrelet Nest Locations in British Columbia: Digital Dataset. ABSTRACT: This data set contains the locations of all known Marbled Murrelet nest locations within British Columbia. Marbled Murrelet is a seabird that flies up to 75 km inland to nest in mostly old-growth forests. The nest is composed of a bowl-shaped depression on moss-covered branches. Due to the cryptic nature of their nesting behaviour, few nests have been found. Most of the nests in this database are located by telemetry techniques. To create a detailed inventory of located Marbled Murrelet nests within British Columbia. This dataset is further used to build a large-scaled GIS Marbled Murrelet distribution model for coastal British Columbia. Nest locations have been derived from various methods, but the majority is derived from one main method. For survey methods, user must refer to the original documents to determine the specific search methodology and for a complete description of the various methodology, and for interpretation of the data..

TITLE: Earthquakes in the USSR, Catalogs and Descriptions. ABSTRACT: The Common System of Seismological Observations is founded and works on the territory of the USSR. It includes the base network of 68 stations and a number of regional subnetworks of stationary seismological stations. The stations have equipment for registration of ground seismic vibrations (seismographs with clock control system). Seismographs are of different types with various amplitude-frequency characteristics and sensitiveness. Information of equipment of the Common System of Seismological Observations of the USSR are regularly published in annual issues (Parameters 19..). Seismograph records (seismograms) are primary station data. These data are subjected to some stage of processing on the stations and in special seismological bodies in the USSR on various levels. Final results of this processing are included into the year-books 'Earthquakes in the USSR in 19...'. These year-books contain annual catalogs of strong earthquakes on all territory of the USSR, annual regional catalogs of earthquakes for 16 seismoactive regions of the USSR, and annual regional catalogs of supplementary parameters of earthquake sources. The first two catalogs include: date and source time of event, latitude, longitude and depth of hypocenter, magnitudes according to various scale, and energy class or intensity of event. The third catalog includes fault plane solutions according to instrumental data in a unified form. Review articles on regional studies including the macroseismic effects of earthquakes and dynamic parameter data for sources are given, as well as individual articles describing a number of strong earthquakes in the USSR with intensity more than 6..

TITLE: Landsat-7 Calibration Parameter File V002. ABSTRACT: The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite on April 15, 1999, marks the addition of the latest satellite to the Landsat satellite series. The Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) Program launched the first of a series of satellites (ERTS 1) in 1972. Part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Earth Resources Survey Program, the ERTS Program and the ERTS satellites were later renamed Landsat to better represent the civil satellite program's prime emphasis on remote sensing of land resources. The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite is part of an ongoing mission to provide quality remote sensing data in support of research and applications activities. The Landsat-7 satellite carries the enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. Radiometric and geometric calibration of both the Landsat-7 satellite and its ETM+ sensor is sustained through the Landsat-7 Image Assessment System. New images are assessed on a daily basis. Radiometric and geometric calibrations are performed as needed and processing parameters are developed for creating level-1 products. Processing parameters are stored in a calibration parameter file (CPF) and fall into one of three categories, including radiometric parameters, geometric parameters, and artifact-removal parameters. Calibration parameters are stored as American Standard Code for Information Interchange text, using an object data language syntax developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The CPF is updated on a regular basis..

TITLE: Hatteras Eddy Cruise 2004. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The Duke   UNC Oceanographic Consortium supported a four-day exploratory cruise off North Carolina in August 2004, to survey physical and biological properties in the vicinity of the cold-core eddies which form along the inner edge of the Gulf Stream. This cruise was the result of a collaborative proposal assembled by Richard Barber, Andy Read, Larry Crowder, David Johnston, Veronica Lance, and David Hyrenbach. PURPOSE: This cruise surveyed marine bird and mammal distributions in the vicinity on the shelf-slope off North Carolina, in an area influenced by the Gulf Stream and by cold-core eddies. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Marine bird and mammal sightings were recorded continuously, while the vessel sailed during daylight hours. The position of the vessel was also recorded every 10 seconds directly from a GPS using the Logger 2000 software, which is publicly available on the internet from the International Fund for Animal Welfare ("http:  www.ifaw.org").

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Chuckchi Sea August 1953-1954 Zooplankton vertical stratified collections on board of the Russian R V Lomonosov, program ANII A-65. ABSTRACT: Zooplankton collections were made to investigate assess interannual changes in species composition, abundance and distribution of the zooplankton in the Chuckchi Sea, one of the biologically lesser known areas of the Arctic. Vertical stratified tows (0-10 m, 10-25 m and 25 m; bottom) were done with a Nansen net (0.5 m diameter, 333 micrometer mesh) at 21 stations in August of 1953 and August of 1954. The ship that was used is R V  Lomonosov; geo-referencing of stations was done. Temperature, salinity and oxygen concentrations were measured at each depth layer. Total zooplankton abundance and biomass in the southern Chuckchi Sea were dominated by North Pacific species (e.g. Metridia pacifica, Eucalanus bungii, Neocalanus plumchrus) and they were higher in 1954 then in 1953, indicating a substantial push of the Bering Sea water onto the Arctic shelf. Pecularities of Russian name translations into English and fieldwork in Russian waters in the mid-1950 should be considered when analyzing these data. The purpose of the dataset is to assess late summer species composition, abundance and distribution of the zooplankton of the Chuckchi Sea for the years 1953-1954..

TITLE: A Preliminary Study on Oxygen Isotopes of Ice Cores from Collins Ice Cap, King George Island, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: Ice-cores of the Collins Ice Cap were all gained through the BZXJ-model ice-core drilling machine newly made by Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. During drilling and collecting ice-cores, strict protection measures against the pollution and melt were taken so that the sample as good as possible to satisfy the demands of physical and chemical analyses of ice-cores. Collected ice-cores were transported under frozen conditions from Antarctica to the low temperature laboratory of Polar Research Institute of China, partly to University of New Hampshire, USA, and were preserved under -25 degrees centigrade. Ice-cores were taken out before analyses, cut apart with a band saw on clean low-temperature working table. We scraped a few millimetres of surface ice to melt under normal air temperature. Oxygen isotope analyses of 0-13.96m depth ice-cores from Big Dome Summit of Collins Ice Cap were completed by the Glacier Research Group, Institute for the Study of Earth, Ocean and Space, University of New Hampshire, USA. Their sampling interval is 15-20cm, total is 87 samples. Oxygen isotope analyses of 13.96-20.02m depth and 27.78-30.52m depth ice-cores from Big Dome Summit of Collins Ice Cap and firn samples drawn from BDA, BDB, BDC and Small Dome Top (SDT) were completed in state key laboratory of mineralization in Nanjing University.

TITLE: Harlequin Duck and waterbird winter surveys around the Wolves Islands, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. ABSTRACT: This data set contains boat-based winter waterbird surveys from the Wolves archipelago in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick Canada. This area is a known wintering location of the Eastern Canadian Harlequin Duck population (appr. 50 birds). Such Harlequin Duck winter surveys were carried out since long time on an occasional and regular basis. The survey effort was shared between the Canadian Wildlife Service, the Provincial Government of New Brunswick and others. The surveys described here stem from wintering Razorbill surveys with ACWERN (Atlantic Cooperative Wildlife Ecology Research Network) and CWS, carried out by Falk Huettmann and colleagues in 1998. Surveys started at Blacks Harbour, mainland New Brunswick. They were boat-based and reported all waterbirds and sea mammals encountered. Most surveys were done during calm weather and in the late morning and noon hours. The purpose of the dataset is to provide general abundance information on wintering Harlequin Ducks, waterbirds, seabirds and sea mammals for the Wolves Archipelago in the Bay of Fundy..

TITLE: Level 3.5 time-averaged VAM analyses of ocean surface wind velocity over 5-days (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov products product079.html ). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com  ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao  ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used ( http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata  ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR ( http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets  ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. The Level 3.5 data products are derived from time averaged Level 3.0 gridded VAM analyses over 5-day and monthly periods. Only those grid points with one or more analyzed observations are used in the average. 5-day means starting on the first day of each year. In leap years, the pentad starting on 2 26 will include 6-days such that the starting date for each pentad remains the same across all years. The level 3.5 data sets are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF, http:  hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu ). All observations are mapped to a 25 km grid and packed into 1-byte integers. Data distributed in NetCDF format ( http:  www.unidata.ucar.edu software netcdf  ). All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s. Each data set is archived using the following naming convention: NAME_YYYYMMDD_vVVlLLPPP.TTT.gz where NAME - unique identifier describing the data YYYYMMDD - date time expressed as year, month, day VV - product version number (in tenths) LL - product level designation (in tenths) PPP - product stream (flk or llk) TTT - file type designating the data format For example, "pentad_20040101_v10l35flk.nc.gz" designates a level 3.5 (l35) data set containing 5-day means for January 1, 2004 from version 1.0 (v10) of the first-look (flk) product stream in NetCDF (.nc) format. The ".gz" node indicates that the file must first be de-compressed using the GNU zip (gzip) compression utility..

TITLE: Enroute Charts, Canada. ABSTRACT: The Enroute Low (LO) and High (HI) Altitude charts provide aeronautical information for instrument navigation in the low and high airway structure of the Canadian Domestic Airspace, the airspace over foreign territory and international waters in which Canada accepts responsibility for the provision of air traffic services and other areas required for military use. The primary purpose of Enroute charts is to depict navigation data in order to provide rapid and precise location and identification of information requisite to instrument navigation. Enroute Low Altitude charts depict aeronautical radio information, airways system, controlled uncontrolled airspace structure, special use airspace, communication stations and selected aerodromes. Vertical coverage is from the surface up to, but not including 18,000' asl. Enroute High Altitude charts depict aeronautical navigation information, airways system, special use airspace, and communication stations critical for flight in the high level structure. Vertical coverage is from 18,000' asl and above. The Enroute series consists of sixteen charts which provide complete coverage of Canada (information on Quebec and the National Capital Region is presented in bilingual format). The charts are printed back-to-back on eight sheets.Used by pilots for low and high altitude instrument navigation in the airway structures.

TITLE: Ice classes - Barents Sea. ABSTRACT: The polar regions hold large masses of water in the form of ice, and this ice has a modifying effect on temperature variations. An increase in the mean temperature of the Arctic, as has been predicted, may result in an intensified melting of the sea ice. While a compact ice cover absorbs 15-50% of the incoming solar radiation, an ice free ocean absorbs about 90%. The absorbed radiation causes warming and evaporation. A change in the ice cover may therefore drastically effect the heat budget of the sea surface. This illustrates an important self-magnifying effect of the increased heat absorption causing the acceleration of ice melting. An increased greenhouse effect due to changes in the gas composition of the atmosphere could therefore be monitored by studying the changes in the total mass of sea ice in the Arctic. Ice charts of the Barents Sea , with the ice separated in ten ice classes, weekly, from 1966 to 1989. The classes are from open water to dense pack ice.

TITLE: Climate Database for the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER). ABSTRACT: The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program and many U. S. Forest Service Experimental Research Stations collect and maintain extensive, long-term ecological databases including streamflow and meteorological measurements. These databases have been widely used in intersite comparisons, modeling studies, and land management-related studies. To facilitate intersite research among the network of LTER sites, information managers have developed a prototype to provide climatic summaries dynamically over the Internet ("http:  www.fsl.orst.edu climhy climdb "), and serves as one model for improving access to data across sites (Baker et al. 2000, Henshaw et al. 1998). Individual sites maintain local climate data in local information systems while a centralized site continually harvests, updates, and provides access to all sites' data through a common database. Common distribution report formats and graphical displays have been established to meet specific needs of climate data users. Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites have generally followed established LTER Climate Committee guidelines (Greenland 1986) for collecting baseline meteorological data. Standardized measurements provide a basis for coordinating meteorological measurements at two or more sites and enable intersite comparisons. However, access to comparable datasets from multiple sites is problematic. While most sites make climate data accessible via the World-Wide Web (WWW), the data are displayed in a variety of formats, are aggregated using different methods, and are often not easily located.

TITLE: Historical Canadian Climate Database - Monthly Homogenized Precipitation and Temperature Data Sets. ABSTRACT: Monthly Rehabilitated Precipitation and Homogenized Temperature Data Sets Climate Research Branch (CCRM) - Environment Canada. A database of homogenized and long-term temperature and precipitation time series has been specifically designed for climate change analyses over Canada. Temperature: The data consist of monthly maximum, minimum and mean temperatures for 210 locations across the country. Series extend back to 1895 where possible: however, data availability over most of the Canadian Arctic is restricted to the mid-1940s to present. Homogeneity problems caused by station relocation and changes in observing procedures were addressed using a regression model technique applied with surrounding stations. Monthly adjustments were obtained for identified inhomogeneities (the cause was often retrieved from the station history files) and a database of monthly maximum, minimum and mean temperatures was created. Precipitation: A total of 495 locations, most with data covering the period 1895-present were used. Data availability in much of the Canadian Arctic was restricted to 1948-present. Adjustments were applied on daily basis for rain and snow separately. Metadata file was created containing all information about the different precipitation measurement programs. For each rain gauge type, different adjustments to account for wind undercatch, evaporation and wetting loss were implemented. For snowfall, ruler measurements were used throughout the time series in order to minimize potential discontinuities introduced by the adoption of Nipher shielded gauge in the mid-1960s. Snow density adjustments based upon coincident ruler and Nipher observations were mapped over the country and applied to the ruler observations. Great care was taken to properly account for the trace measurements.To provide Canadian precipitation and temperature data sets for climate research.

TITLE: The Living Marine Resources Program. ABSTRACT: The Living Marine Resources (LMR) program assembles information on the spatial and temporal distributions and characteristics of selected coastal and marine species. These data are used to describe and illustrate the diversity of species within the estuarine, coastal, and oceanic waters of the United States. Data also are collected on such variables as management and commercial usage of the selected species and biological aspects of the surrounding marine environment. The relative abundance and spatial distribution over time is examined for a variety of important coastal and marine species. Species are selected according to a set of criteria, which consider their economic value; endangered, threatened, or protected status; and ecological importance (defined in such terms as being a major component of the ecosystem, a major food source, or a competitor with other important species for food). Representative species include marine and estuarine fishes and invertebrates; seabirds and ocean-associated waterfowl; and marine mammals. The number and variety of species examined by the LMR program differ for each coastal region. LMR data describe and illustrate the life history of selected species across space and through time. Much of this information is presented in the form of regional data maps. These maps display such species-specific data as overall distribution; areas of adult and juvenile abundance; important reproduction sites, such as spawning areas or nesting sites; migration and movement patterns; and areas that are important for other life history functions, such as feeding areas, and migration staging areas. Information also is provided on such topics as species classification; worldwide range; human uses (commercial, recreational and subsistence); habitat requirements (boundary divisions, substrate type, and salinity ranges); social behavior; feeding behavior; reproduction characteristics; development and growth characteristics; factors influencing population (natural, human-related, and potential vulnerabilities); population size; and management practices. In addition, LMR data describe and illustrate important marine ecosystem characteristics, including patterns of primary productivity (phytoplankton), zooplankton biomass, and benthic biomass. The LMR program includes data for all major coastal regions of the United States, excluding the Great Lakes. Data are organized separately into four regional components: The East Coast; Gulf of Mexico; West Coast; and the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. Separate data bases identify marine mammal and seabird distributions for the entire West Coast of North America, from the Bering strait to the Baja Peninsula. For each coastal region the study area extends from inshore, estuarine basins to offshore waters, within and beyond the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Information Products: Program results are summarized in a series of regional assessment reports. In addition, LMR data are presented with other information associated with coastal and offshore environments in a series of regional strategic assessment data atlases. Individual data maps also are produced for specific species and regions. A desktop computer information system (CMas), developed to examine and analyze LMR data is described below. These reports are available at cost or as PDF files: "http:  spo.nwr.noaa.gov olo99.htm" and "http:  www.st.nmfs.gov st2 tm_spo19 spo19.html".

TITLE: Radiocarbon Dates and Pollen Data, Peterson Erosional Remnant, Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of pollen data and radiocarbon (C14) dates resulting from microscopic analysis and mass spectrometry of soil cores taken from the Peterson Erosional Remnant, located on the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, Alaska. Data are contained in four files, and include raw pollen counts listed by depth; counts for each coded pollen or microfossil type for each depth; the percent of each pollen or microfossil type by depth; radiocarbon (C14) dates expressed in calibrated years BP; and a pollen dictionary of codes used and Latin pollen microfossil names.

TITLE: Canadian Cryospheric Information Network Database. ABSTRACT: Access to timely, comprehensive, and quality cryospheric data is an obstacle to improved knowledge and understanding of the cryosphere in Canada. Important datasets often reside in various government and university labs where they remain largely unknown or access restrictions prevent effective use. Through a data and information management infrastructure, the Canadian Cryospheric Information Network (CCIN) addresses these problems by improving availability and access to Canadian cryospheric datasets. Developed in concert with the CRYSYS project, as a collaborative partnership between the Federal Government (Canadian Space Agency, Meteorological Service of Canada, Natural Resources Canada), University of Waterloo and Noetix Research Inc., the CCIN has established a one-stop entry point for researchers to discover and access legacy data, near real-time data, current state of the cryosphere information, on-demand statistical-graph analysis, and dynamic linkages to other major data providers including GeoConnections, The Climate and Cryosphere Project, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. All data provided by the CCIN, locally or remotely, is accessible via the World Wide Web. Beyond data storage, distribution, and providing tools for graphical analysis, CCIN has invested in outreach initiatives for greater visibility within the public community. The CCIN presents special online sections for cryosphere news, the media, and a youth oriented Canadian cryosphere website comprised of facts, quizzes and interactive games. As a data and information centre, CCIN continues to build upon its aggregate features to improve existing tools, implement new technologies, to promote the awareness of the Canadian cryosphere, while progressing with data collection and data rescue.To provide accurate and timely information on cryospheric variability and change to the public and decision makers.

TITLE: Catalog of boreholes from Russia and Mongolia. ABSTRACT: This catalog of boreholes from across Russia and Mongolia includes those published in papers and monographs as well as other literature of limited circulation. The 122 boreholes were used to derive a characterization of the Russian territory according to eight geocryological regions. Five boreholes are included for Mongolia. Data from these boreholes were used in the generation of the Circum-arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-Ice Conditions (Brown et al., 1997). Data obtained from various sources as noted within each borehole entry. The time period varies for each borehole, but is primarily from the late 1980s to early 1990s. Observation methods include 'Standard logging', a combined natural gamma logging, electric logging and well caliper logging; 'Geothermal observations' which demonstrate the thickness of layer with the temperature below zero (data of Yakutsk Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch, Academy of Sciences of the USSR); visual observations on ice-content in the core, and depth of appearance of fresh water table; thermologging of the boreholes (studies of 'PGO Yakutskgeologia'); and electric, well caliper and thermal logging in pioneer and exploratory oil and gas wells ('PGO Lenaneftegasgeologia' studies). The permafrost base is exposed by a number of adjacent boreholes; interval of fluctuations of permafrost depth is shown. The data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998..

TITLE: Dissolved Mn in the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: Sampling and Analytical Methodology: Samples were taken using 24 internally Teflon-coated PVC 12 litre GO-FLO Samplers (General Oceanics Inc.) mounted on an all-titanium frame (De Baar et al., 2008). This frame was connected to a 17.7 mm diameter Kevlar hydrowire with seven independent internal signal conductor cables (Cousin Trestec S.A.) and controlled from onboard. Each GO-FLO sampler had a special ultraclean all-teflon PTFE valve (Cole Parmer; PN A-06392-31) installed. Samples for trace metal analysis were collected from the GO-FLO bottles in a class 100 clean room environment. The water was filtered over a 0.2 μm filter cartridge (Sartrobran-300, Sartorius) under pressure (1.5 atm) of (in-line prefiltered) nitrogen gas exerted via a special connector instead of the regular air bleeding valve at the top of each GO-FLO sampler. Sub-samples for Mn were taken in cleaned LDPE sample bottles (125 mL) from each GO-FLO bottle. All sample bottles were rinsed five times with the sample seawater. Analyses of dissolved Manganese (Mn) were performed on shipboard with the method developed by Doi et al. (2004) with some slight modifications in the preparation and brands of the chemicals used. Furthermore, samples were buffered in-line with an ammonium borate sample buffer (see text below). Samples were acidified with 12 M ultraclean HCl (Baseline® Hydrochloric Acid, Seastar Chemicals Inc.) to a pH of 1.8 and stored inside double plastic bags in plastic crates. At the home institute, in a flow injection system, the samples were buffered in-line to a pH of 8.5 ± 0.2 with ammonium borate sample buffer. This buffer was produced by dissolving 30.9 grams of boric acid (Suprapure, Merck) in 1 L MQ water and adjusting the pH to 9.4 with ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure, Merck). Dissolved Mn in the buffered sample was preconcentrated for 200 seconds on a Toyopearl AFChelate 650M (TesoHaas, Germany) column. Hereafter the column was rinsed for 60 seconds with MQ water to remove interfering salts. The Mn was subsequently eluted from the column for 200 seconds with a solution of 0.1M three times quartz distilled formic acid (reagent grade, Merck) containing 0.1 M hydrogen peroxide (Suprapure, Merck) and 12 mM ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure, Merck). The pH of this carrier solution was adjusted to 2.9 ± 0.05. The eluate with the dissolved Mn passed a second column of immobilized 8-hydroxyquinoline (Landing et al., 1986) to remove interfering iron ions in the carrier solution (Doi et al., 2004). Hereafter the carrier mixed subsequently with 0.7 M ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure Merck) and a luminol solution. The latter luminol solution was made by diluting 600 μl luminol stock solution and 10 μl TETA (triethylenetetramine, Merck) in 1 L MQ. The luminol stock solution was made by diluting 270 mg luminol (3-aminophtalhydrazide, Aldrich) and 500 mg potassium carbonate in 15 ml MQ. The resulting mixture of carrier solution, ammonium hydroxide and luminol solution had a pH of 10.2 ± 0.05 and entered a 3 meter length mixing coil placed in a water bath of 25°C. Hereafter the chemiluminescence was detected with a Hamamatsu HC135 Photon counter. Concentrations of dissolved Mn were calculated in nanomol•L-1 (nM) from the photon emission peak height (see below). The system was calibrated using standard additions from a 5000 nM Mn stock solution (Fluka) to filtered acidified seawater with low concentrations of Mn that was collected in the region. A five-points calibration line (0, 0.36, 0.73, 1.46 and 2.18 nM standard additions) and blank determination were made daily. The 3 lowest points (0, 0.36 and 0.73 nM) of the calibration line were measured in triplicate and the 2 highest points in duplicate to add more weight to the lower part of the calibration line. The blank was determined by measuring column cleaned seawater. Latter was obtained by passing seawater over a Toyopearl AFChelate 650M and an 8-hydroxyquinoline column which retained the dissolved Mn. The average blank value was 20 pM. The limit of detection defined as three times the standard deviation of the blank was < 0.01 nM. The flow injection system was rinsed every day with a 0.5 M HCl solution. Data Processing: A standard was measured in triplicate every day. This standard was a sub-sample of a 25 L volume of filtered seawater that was taken at the beginning of the cruise in the Barents Sea. The relative standard deviation of the replicate analysis seawater sample that was analysed 22 times on different days in triplicate was 2.19%. The relative standard deviation on the separate days was on average 1.21 %. The average concentration of Mn of this standard was 1.0 nM and the deviation from this average for a given measuring day was used as a correction factor. To verify whether this correction was decreasing the inter-daily variability in the dataset, every day a sample which was collected and measured the previous measuring day, was analysed once again. The deviation between the concentrations measured on the different days decreased from 3.28% to 2.68%, indicating the data correction procedure is beneficial. As an independent comparison, the certification samples collected on the American SAFe cruise (Johnson et al., 2007) were analysed in triplicate for Mn. The resulting concentrations of Mn for both SAFe Surface (S) and SAFe deep (D2) from 1000 m, agreed very nicely the community consensus value that is starting to emerge on the absolute concentrations of Mn in the SAFe samples. The dataset was scanned for obvious outliers and these have been quality flagged with the number 4. Some samples gave anomalous nutrient results for the intended depth and were assumed to have been closed at the wrong depth and quality flagged with the number 8. In the Laptev Sea some very high concentrations of Mn were observed and these were out of range for the method used and flagged with the number 5. All other values are assumed to be correct and flagged with the number 0..

TITLE: BIGFOOT NPP SURFACES FOR NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN SITES, 2000-2004. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BigFoot project gathered Net Primary Production (NPP) data for nine EOS Land Validation Sites located from Alaska to Brazil from 2000 to 2004. Each site is representative of one or two distinct biomes, including the Arctic tundra; boreal evergreen needleleaf forest; temperate cropland, grassland, evergreen needleleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest; desert grassland and shrubland; and tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. At this time we are archiving Northern Old Black Spruce (NOBS - BOREAS NSA, Canada) and Harvard Forest LTER (HARV - Massachusetts, USA) data collected in 2001.The NPP surfaces were produced by a spatial version of an ecosystem process model named, Biome-BGC. Inputs to the model included Landsat ETM+ derived Land Cover and LAI, tower derived meteorological variables, and a set of site-level ecophysical parameters. The model was calibrated using field measured NPP and validated by tower derived estimates of GPP. Each BigFoot NPP product covers a 7 x 7 km extent and consists of the NPP surface in ASCII Raster (BIL - Band Interleaved by Line) format (280 rows by 280 columns at 25 meter resolution) and an accompanying text file which provides metadata specific to the image (such as projection, data type, etc).igFoot Project Background: Reflectance data from MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra (http:  landval.gsfc.nasa.gov MODIS index.php), is used to produce several science products including land cover, leaf area index (LAI), gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). The overall goal of the BigFoot Project was to provide validation of these products. To do this, BigFoot combined ground measurements, additional high resolution remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at nine flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products. BigFoot characterized up to a 7 x 7 km area (49 MODIS pixels) surrounding the CO2 flux towers located at each of the nine sites. We collected multi-year, in situ measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allowed us to examine scales and spatial pattern of these properties, the inter-annual variability and validity of MODIS products, and provided for a field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint. BigFoot was funded by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program..

TITLE: POLES Sea Ice Model Forcing Data Set. ABSTRACT: This data set provides atmospheric fields which can be used as forcing fields for driving dynamic thermodynamic sea ice models of the Arctic Ocean. Geostrophic winds are calculated from the twice daily IABP sea-level pressures blended with the daily NCAR reanalysis sea level pressures. The thermal forcing is calculated based on Parkinson and Washington(1979) using IABP-POLES surface air temperature data provided by I. Rigor. Ocean velocity and heat flux are output from a coupled ice-ocean model. The sea ice model is a multi-category thickness distribution model and the ocean model is a 3D primitive equation model(see Zhang et al.1998). There are two sets of files. One set contains the geostrophic winds, the other the thermal forcing data. The filenames are in the form: poles_frc_therm.<yyyy>.<version> and poles_frc_wind.<yyyy>.<version> where yyyy is the year, and version refers to a version number. The data are flat binary files (no headers) consisting of short integers. The data were written as unformatted direct access files on an HP workstation using HP-UX 10.20.Byte order may have to be changed if you are using a machine using a different byte order (e.g. DEC, ooops Compac machines). A Fortran program demonstrating how to read the data is provided. The specific structure of the data set should be apparent from that program..

TITLE: Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas. ABSTRACT: The Environmental Working Group (EWG) was established in June 1995 under the framework of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. In order to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic, the EWG Arctic Climatology Project compiled digital data for arctic regions in January 1996. This work led to a set of three atlases on CD-ROM for arctic oceanography, sea ice, and meteorology. U.S. and Russian partners developed the EWG Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas. The U.S. Navy submarine and Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) community strongly supported this project. The U.S. Arctic Submarine Laboratory and the National Ice Center (NIC) Naval Ice Center (NAVICE)--a joint agency supported by the U.S. Navy, NOAA, and the U.S. Coast Guard--prepared the data. The Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg contributed sea ice data and analyses. The U.S. Environmental Research Institute in Michigan designed and compiled the CD-ROM and served as managing editor of the project.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships. For more detailed information, see the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for MODIS Detached Coccolith Concentration http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod23.pdf The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Calcite (CLCT) data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA L3SMI .

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Seasonal Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Ifremer BIOCEAN database (Deep Sea Benthic Fauna). ABSTRACT: The Biocean database was designed to gather the extremely large volume of data collected from different deep-sea ecosystem studies conducted by Ifremer's department of "Environnement Profond" and aims at facilitating ecosystem studies in the deep sea. It represents an important new resource for deep-sea ecologists and will have wide applications in biogeography, and biodiversity studies.. The relational database is available online and contains data covering 30 years of French deep-sea oceanographic research. This database comes in a six-application package; two of them are used on research vessels to collect operational data, whereas the others are used to link with a core database back on land. The latter are used to: (1) manage the taxonomic nomenclature, (2) monitor the identification of faunal collections and (3) fill in chemical analyses results or measurement data files (4) add or extract data from the database. BIOCEAN was designed to facilitate ecosystem studies in the deep sea. 24,426 records representing 3,156 species are present. Faunal collection with traditional gear (cores and trawls), submersible Nautile and ROV Victor (Remotely Operated Vehicle). Habitats covered include:deep-water benthic ecosystems including hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, deep-coral reefs and sediments.

TITLE: ArcticRIMS: A Regional, Integrated Hydrological Monitoring System for the Pan-Arctic Landmass. ABSTRACT: The Arctic Rapid Integrated Monitoring System (ArcticRIMS) uses products from numerical weather prediction models (NCEP NCAR, ERA-40, station records, satellite remote sensing, and other data sets) in conjunction with an atmosphere-land surface water budgeting scheme. The geography and dynamics of water across the pan-Arctic region are important elements of the larger Earth system especially given growing evidence of the vulnerability of the Arctic climate and terrestrial biosphere to global change. The Arctic freshwater cycle figures prominently into any analysis of these dynamic systems. In addition to historical time series, updates are compiled of various gridded fields. These include precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, soil freeze thaw state, active layer thickness, snow extent and its water equivalent, soil water storage, runoff and simulated discharge. Products are periodically refined as improved data sets and techniques become available..

TITLE: Fishbase. ABSTRACT: FishBase is a global information system covering all aspects of fish biology, ecology, population dynamics, life history, and usage by humans. The information is provided in monthly updates at http:  www.fishbase.org . Occurrence data stem mostly from museum collections, less from surveys and the scientific literature; in addition, about 1,000 observation records were reported by the public (fish watchers). Fish were collected with varying gear and deposit of specimens; also trawl surveys and a few individual observations, e.g. by anglers or divers. Habitat coverage includes, marine, brackish, and freshwater. FishBase is a relational database with information to cater to different professionals such as research scientists, fisheries managers, zoologists and many more. FishBase on the web contains practically all fish species known to science. The FishBase 2000 release summarizes the accumulation and structuring of knowledge on fish biology and ecology over the more than 10 years since its inception. FishBase 2000 now covers over 25,000 species of fish known to science, has over 70,000 synonyms and 100,000 common names in over 200 languages. The names are the key to accessing knowledge accumulated over time and mobilising scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems. Over 25,000 pictures illustrate these fish and information about them has been extracted from 20,000 references. The classification of higher taxa follows the version of Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes updated in November 2000. The FishBase 2000 CD-ROM contains full information on 25,000 species and comes on 4 CD-ROMS. This following information is for obtaining the CD version. The FishBase book has 344 pages and gives in-depth information about the concepts and data sources of FishBase. It can also be used as a textbook as it explains many concepts in the fields of biodiversity, fish and fisheries. You can order FishBase by sending a US$ 95 cheque from a US-based bank, payable to 'ICLARM', to ICLARM FishBase, MCPO Box 2631, 0718 Makati City, Philippines. Alternatively, you can send a 99 cheque payable to FishBase, to FishBase, IfM, Duesternbrooker Weg 20, 24105 Kiel, Germany. Institutions can order FishBase with a regular invoice. Registered owners of previous copies of FishBase can obtain upgrades for US$ 50 or 55. Prices include shipping by airmail. All classes of fishes are represented, Myxini (hagfishes), Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys), Holocephali (chimaeras), Elasmobranchii (sharks & rays), Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes), and Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes), with altogether 29,200 of 30,000 estimated species.

TITLE: Western Interior Seaway Drilling Project Data. ABSTRACT: This data set presents the results of a coordinated, multidisciplinary study of Cretaceous carbonate and clastic rocks in cores collected along an E-W transect across the old Cretaceous seaway that extended from the Gulf Coast to the Arctic by a team of academic, industry, and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists. The overall goal of the study was to construct a subsurface transect of mid-Cretaceous strata that were deposited in the U.S. Western Interior Seaway (WIS), ranging from pelagic, organic-carbon rich, marine hydrocarbon source rocks in Kansas and eastern Colorado to nearshore, coal-bearing units in western Colorado and Utah. This transect of cores has provided the basis for paleoenvironmental interpretation of organic-carbon burial in an epicontinental, foreland basin setting. In part, the objectives of our study were motivated by the research emphases outlined by the Cretaceous Rhythms, Events and Resources (CRER) Project of the Global Sedimentary Geology Program. In particular, the papers in this volume focus on the Graneros Shale, Greenhorn Formation, Carlile Shale, and Niobrara Formation and equivalents in cores from drillholes from western Kansas, eastern Colorado, and eastern Utah. This series of cores provides unweathered samples and continuous, smooth exposures required for geochemical studies, mineralogical investigations, and biostratigraphic studies. Information for the eastern end of the transect was obtained from a hole that was drilled in 1988 and continuously cored (with better than 90% recovery) by Amoco Production Company in western Kansas (Amoco Rebecca K. Bounds #1, Greeley County, Kansas). A Core from the western end of the transect was obtained in 1991 when the USGS drilled and continuously cored (with better than 98% recovery) a hole in the Kaiparowits Basin near the town of Escalante in south central Utah (USGS Escalante #1) A third hole (USGS Portland #1), was drilled by the USGS and continuously cored (with essentially 100% recovery) in Cretaceous strata in the Cañon City Basin near Florence, Colorado. A fourth hole was originally planned for the San Juan Basin in southwestern Colorado. The need for this hole was eliminated when Mark Leckie and colleagues continuously trenched a section of the Mancos Shale at the northern border of Mesa Verde National Park between Durango and Cortez, Colorado. Other outcrop sections of Mancon Shale and age-equivalent strata also were sampled and studied by Leckie and colleagues, and their results are reported in the SEPM volume. Other pre-existing cores that were used for parts of the study include Plains Resources Schock Errington #1, Sherman County, Kansas; Coquina Oil Corporation Berthoud State #3 and #4, Larimer County, Colorado; and Princeton University PU79 near Pueblo, Colorado. All cores are presently archived in the USGS Core Research Center (USGS-CRC) in Denver. The data consists of: Amoco Bounds Core USGS Escalante Core USGS Portland Core Coquina Oil Berthoud State Cores Leckie Outcrop Data.

TITLE: LANDSAT MSS Raw Data Product. ABSTRACT: Most of the ESA archive has been acquired and processed at receiving stations in Fucino (Italy), Kiruna (Sweden) and Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain). However, the archive contains also a substantial number of data acquired and processed by receiving stations elsewhere (e.g. the US, Brasil, Canada, etc.). Landsat MSS Raw CCT data contain data at 6 bits with none of the geometric and radiometric corrections applied. The Ancillary Data Block (ACB) gives the exact line length. The video data of different bands are registered at integer pixels to account for detector layout geometry and multiplexer sampling lines. The pixels (2 on the right and 2 on the left side of the image) corresponding to geometrical locations not sampled by all detectors are still present on the video data. Landsat MSS Raw is available in a digital format for Full Scene. Landsat full scene of imagery data correspond to an effective ground coverage area of approximately 185 km wide by 185 km in along-track direction for Landsat 1,2,3 and 185 x 170 for Landsat 4 and 5. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection between a path and row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 20 km). For a floating full scene the placement along the path is chosen by the customer. The centre point of the floating full scene is defined by the path number and the required latitude. A full image is composed of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each band requires 40 Mbytes of storage space. To order data please see http:  earth.esa.int helpandmail help_order.html.

TITLE: Geoscience Compilation of Northern Baffin Island and Northern Melville Peninsula, Canada. ABSTRACT: The North Baffin Island and Melville Peninsula project was co-sponsored by the Geological Survey of Canada, Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories (Nunavut as of April 1, 1999). The purpose of this project is to make information about the rocks and soils of the area easier to obtain, to understand, and to use, by providing geoscience information to northern communities and the general public. Potential applications include land-use planning and management, education and mineral exploration. The contents of the two CD-ROM set represent the culmination of a one-year compilation for the North Baffin and Northern Melville Peninsula regions in the new Nunavut territory. This geoscience knowledge base is a seamless, multi-thematic integrated data set. Geoscience data layers include 1:500,000-scale bedrock geology, surficial geology, mineral occurrences and metallogenic domains, geophysical and geochronological data and Precambrian fossil localities. Underlying this information is a seamless topographic base with lakes, drainage, coastlines and elevation data. Hard copy maps of bedrock geology (GSC Open File 3633, 1:500,000), surficial geology (GSC Open File 3634, 1:500,000) and metallogenic domains with mineral occurrences (GSC Open File 3635, 1:1,000,000) have been derived from this knowledge base.To stimulate mineral exploration, effective land-use planning and management, identify carving stone resources, and northern community capacity building.

TITLE: Rock Glaciers, Disko Island, Greenland. ABSTRACT: Disko Island (8600 km2) is situated west of central mainland Greenland. The island is part of the Tertiary volcanic province of West Greenland and is mainly made up by lavas. The landscape is a plateau basalt landscape with cirque carved lava plateaus and U-shaped valleys and fjords. Rock glaciers are frequent in Disko Island (Humlum, 1982). In southern Disko Island, about 60 km SSE of the two study sites, meteorological observations have been carried out since 1923 in the village of Godhavn. The present (1961-1990) mean annual air temperature is -3.9 C, the coldest month is March (-15.1 C), and July is the warmest month (7.1 C). The mean annual precipitation at Godhavn is about 400 mm water equivalent. Most of the precipitation (75 %) usually falls during the period June to December, associated with advection of moist, maritime air masses from the south and southwest along the Davis Strait. The remaining part of the year is comparatively dry, as it is dominated by cold and dry katabatic air masses flowing off the Greenland Ice Sheet to the east. Approximately 60-70 % of the mean annual precipitation is snow and in Godhavn a persistent snow cover is registered from late September to late May. No systematic mapping of permafrost or permafrost related terrain features have been carried out in this part of West Greenland. Weidick (1968), however, places Disko Island within the zone of continuous permafrost. This is supported by the occurrence of open system pingos (Christiansen, 1995) and numerous rock glaciers (Humlum, 1982, 1984, 1988a, 1988b, 1996; Humlum et al., 1995; Rasch et al. 1996), which are geomorphic indications of the presence of widespread permafrost in Disko Island. Adopting a standard continental geothermal gradient of about 0.033 C m-1, the mean annual air temperature of -7.5 C (1991-96) indicates a potential permafrost thickness of about 175-225 m. This estimate is presumably somewhat conservative, as the Little Ice Age annual air temperature presumably was about 2C below modern values (Humlum, 1996), which would provide conditions for a somewhat thicker permafrost layer than is suggested by modern meteorological values. The high frequency of rock glaciers on Disko Island is presumably derived from high rock weathering rates (Humlum, 1992). These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998..

TITLE: The legacy model vs the subsidy model to explain soil organic matter in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. ABSTRACT: The Dry Valleys of Victoria Land, Antarctica, contain naturally simple ecosystems operating under extreme climatic conditions. Nutrients are limited and are thought to come from external sources from more productive parts of the landscape or from other ecosystems entirely, such as the lakes occurring in the valleys. A ‘legacy’ model suggests the origin of present day soil organic matter to be material laid down in ancient lake beds rather than aeolian dispersal from modern aquatic environments, as previously thought. This does not appear to hold true for smaller dry valleys and instead a ‘subsidy’ model was investigated by testing several hypotheses with a combination of: a survey of the physical and biological characteristics of the eight key landscape elements identified in the valley, experimentally measuring the benefit of wind-blown subsidies to terrestrial microbial populations and the nature of the beneficial component of the subsidies. In each of the landscapes, the soil respiration, terrestrial photosynthesis (moss colonies and cyanobacterial mats on the soil), terrestrial nitrogen fixation, approximate area covered by communities undertaking carbon and nitrogen fixation and the transfer of organic material between aquatic and terrestrial environments was quantified. The results of these measurements will be a carbon and nitrogen budget for terrestrial communities in the valley system. The parameters and landscape scale resource budgets were tested by comparing the conditions in the Garwood Valley with those in the western Wright Valley, which is characterised by an entirely internal drainage system (the Onyx River flowing into Lake Vanda), a much less productive lake that occupies a much smaller areal proportion of the total valley floor, and a climate more influenced by the extremes of arid katabatic winds. Studies were in the 04 05 and 05 06 seasons in the Garwood Valley (Lake Colleen and Buddha Lake) and the Wright Valley (Lake Vanda)..

TITLE: Temperature, Pressure and Potential Vorticity Fields at Theta Surfaces from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting. ABSTRACT: The pressure, temperature and potential vorticity (PV) fields are used for European stratospheric ozone research projects, such as EASOE and SESAME as well as other EU funded projects. The PV, pressure and temp. on the different isentropic levels are calculated from the ECMWF T213 initialized analysis extracted at a 1.125 degree lat-lon grid. The trajectories are 10 day backward analyses ending at a large number of stations and grid points in Europe, Asia and the Arctic. The trajectory data contain information on the geographical position, temperature and PV along the trajectory. The time step is 2 hours. For both the fields and trajectories there are data for 12 UT every day from early November through April starting Nov. 1991. The PV and temperature on the different isentropic levels are calculated from the ECMWF T213 initialized analysis extracted as a 1.25 degree lat-lon grid. PV is calculated using a centered difference scheme except between the two upper levels (10 and 30hPa) of the ECMWF model. There are substantial errors on PV. This is primarily due to the coarse vertical interpolations and unreal small-scale structures in The only difference is that the trajectory calculation is done in a 1.5 degree distance grid, so the difference between them is small. The data are, however, only available in a 2.5 degree distance grid at NILU, but PV is calculated for every station using the finer grid and are available in the directory:  nadir data ecmwf pvatstat YYYY MM The isentropic data are organised into year(YYYY) and month(MM) in the subdirectories:  nadir data ecmwf isentrop YYYY MM The data are stored in files with names: atYYMMDD.HHH where YYMMDD gives the date of the analyses and HHH is the forecast hour. HHH equals 000 for the 12 UT analysis. HHH equals 12, 36 and 60 hoursfor the forecast based on on the 0UT analyses, while HHH equals 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 192 for the forecast based on the 12 UT analyses. Thus, at951128.012 is the 12 hour forecast from 0 UT analysis on November 28, 1995, which is valid at 12 UT on November 28, 1995. The forecast in at951127.24 is also valid at this time, but since it is a longer forecast, it should not be used. However, the forecasts based on the 0 UT analyses, will arrive later at NILU (at about 6 UT). Note, that on the first day of a month you have to go to the directory of the previous month, to get the forecast based on the 12 UT analysis..

TITLE: Baseline concentrations of elements in the Antarctic macrolichen Umbilicaria decussata. ABSTRACT: Total concentrations of major and trace elements were determined in samples of the epilithic lichen Umbilicaria decussata from 24 ice-free areas in coastal Victoria Land (Antarctica) during 1991 - 2001. Overall average concentrations of trace elements except Cd were the lowest ever reported for lichens of the genus Umbilicaria. Specifically, the mean level of Pb in lichen from granitic rock (0.46 + - 0.18 mg g-1 dry wt) was more than four times lower than the lowest record in Arctic lichens. No impact of local human activities was detected, but the elemental composition of U. decussata was affected by entrapment of soil of rock dust particles and probably by uptake of soluble elements from substrate. Relationship between elements and their distributions patterns in the study area indicated that the marine environment is the main source of major ions and perhaps of Cd in lichens. Accumulation of P was detected in samples from coastal sites frequented by seabirds. Although the present results can be taken as baseline levels of major and trace elements in Antarctic U. decussata from substrates with very different geochemical features, further research is necessary to evaluate the relative element contribution from each substrate with respect to those from snow, marine aerosol, salt encrustation and guano..

TITLE: Database of animal specimens from polar regions. ABSTRACT: The Division of Biological Collection at the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) has been taking care of biological specimens collected by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions (JAREs) and through other research activities in Arctic and Antarctic regions. The collection has been loaned for scientific researches and exhibitions at museums etc. for public education. Moss specimens in the collection were registered at a herbaria, coded as "NIPR" and animal specimens were catalogued in a publication (National Institute of Polar Research, 1987) for scientific or educational users. To make better use of the animal specimens, about 500 items at present, we set up a database which can be searched for appropriate specimens through images of each items for any particular purposes, scientific or educational. We hope this database will help increase understanding of the animals living in polar regions. Even though the collection includes unidentified specimens or those with incomplete data, we would like to improve the collection with cooperation of related research fellows..

TITLE: Circulation in the Freshwater Switchyard of the Arctic Ocean: Helicopter CTD Profile Data 2003-2005. ABSTRACT: The Freshwater Switchyard of the Arctic Ocean (FSAO) project includes a helicopter based at Alert on northern Ellesmere Island to carry out oceanographic surveys northward across the shelf break in late spring. The 'freshwater switchyard' is a region to the north of the eastern Canadian Archipelago and Greenland that is hypothesized as a bifurcation point for freshwater transfer between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Measurements were made in April and or May of 2003, 2004, and 2005 using a Seabird SBE 19plus Seacat internally recording CTD instrument with an SBE 43 dissolved oxygen sensor. Data include depth, pressure, temperature in situ, potential temperature, conductivity, salinity, and density. 2003 and 2004 data also include dissolved oxygen; in 2005 the oxygen sensor failed. Each cast reaches about 500 meters unless the ocean depth at that position is less. Further information and photography from the 2005 survey are posted at the project Web site, The Freshwater Switchyard of the Arctic Ocean (http:  psc.apl.washington.edu switchyard index.html). Data are in space-delimited ASCII format, and are available via FTP. The FSAO project is a program to study freshwater circulation (sea ice and upper ocean) in the 'freshwater switchyard' between Alert (Ellesmere Island) and the North Pole, through a series of annual springtime hydrographic surveys. These surveys are intended to measure the eastward-flowing boundary current and also determine water property changes that occur in the transition from the deep Arctic Ocean basin to the shallow continental shelf. These data represent the first three years of surveys in 2003-2005; additional surveys are planned through 2007..

ABSTRACT: [Source: NOAA Climate Prediction Center, http:  www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov  ] The Polar  Eurasian pattern appears only in the winter, and is the most prominent mode of low-frequency variability during December and February. The pattern consists of one main anomaly center over the polar region, and separate centers of opposite sign to the polar anomaly over Europe and northeastern China. Thus, the pattern reflects major changes in the strength of the circumpolar circulation, and reveals the accompanying systematic changes which occur in the midlatitude circulation over large portions of Europe and Asia. The polar Eurasian pattern exhibits strong intradecadal and interdecadal variability, with several consecutive winters of a positive phase of the pattern often followed by several winters having a negative phase of the pattern. For example, the winters from 1964 65 through 1969 70 were dominated by a negative phase of the pattern, followed by a five-year period from 1971 72 through 1975 76 dominated by a positive phase of the pattern. A negative phase then returned for much of the decade between 1976 77 and 1985 86, followed by a prolonged positive phase of the pattern from 1988 89 through 1992 93. These prolonged positive phases of the pattern reflected below-normal heights throughout the polar region and an enhanced circumpolar vortex, in combination with above-normal heights over much of Europe and eastern Asia. In contrast, the prolonged negative phases of the pattern reflected above-normal heights throughout the polar region and a weaker than normal polar vortex, in combination with below-normal heights over much of Europe and eastern Asia..

TITLE: National Scale Frameworks Populated Places, Canada. ABSTRACT: Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data are standardized national coverages of commonly used geospatial data sets at the 1:1 000 000 scale. A variety of framework layers (e.g. hydrology, roads, railways, populated places) have been integrated so that their relative positions are correct. Hydrology (which includes coastline) is the base layer to which all others are fitted. In addition, the Atlas of Canada National Frameworks collection forms a base to which an increasing number of national scale thematic frameworks from other Federal Government agencies are integrated (e.g. ecological regions, census subdivisions). National Scale Frameworks Populated Places, Canada is a selection of named populated places suitable for use at a scale of 1:1 000 000. The points have been fitted to other National Scale Frameworks layers. Therefore, points represent the approximate locations of places relative to these other layers. A subset of data from the Canadian Geographical Names Data Base (CGNDB) were used. The CGNDB is maintained by the Names Section of the Centre for Topographic Information (Government of Canada, Natural Resources Canada). The selection of features was based on population size, historical significance and noteworthiness. Cartographic considerations were also taken into account.The Atlas of Canada National Scale Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Historical Isotopic Temperature Record from the Vostok Ice Core. ABSTRACT: Glacial-interglacial temperature records were derived from the 2083-m ice core from Vostok, Antarctica, obtained during a series of drillings in th early 1970s and 1980. Temperature records were derived from isotopes of oxygen-18 and deuterium in snowfall. Drilling continued at Vostok and was completed in January 1998, reaching a depth of 3623 m, the deepest ice core ever recovered (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). The resulting core allows the ice core record of climate properties at Vostok to be extended to about 420 kyr BP. The 420-kyr Vostok temperature record in this dataset was reconstructed from the continuous deuterium profile measured along the core. The new measurements were taken along ice in increments between 0.5 and 2 m in length to a depth of 2080 m and then every 1 m for the remainder of the upper 3310-m of the ice core. Isotopic analysis was again performed by the Geochemistry team at LSCE at Saclay. The tabulated data show the annual temperature variation relative to the mean annual surface temperature for Vostok (-55.5 C). The Vostok temperature data is available via ftp from: "http:  cdiac.esd.ornl.gov ftp trends temp vostok vostok.1999.temp.dat".

TITLE: Labitzke Berlin Stratospheric Data: Zonal Mean Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of Northern Hemisphere monthly zonal mean geopotential heights and temperature. Gridded data are available from 10N to 90N at 10x10 degrees at 100 hPa, 50 hPa, 30 hPa, and 10 hPa. Muench and Borden (1962) had analyzed monthly mean stratospheric charts from 1955-1959. From these data, B. Naujokat extrapolated the 30-hPa North Pole temperatures for the period July 1955 till June 1957 which enlarges our data set for the North Pole. The other temperature data were extrapolated from our daily maps until 1965 when the temperature analyses were published together with the maps and digitized accordingly, like the height maps. As this is a set of temperature data which is not included in the Berlin Series on the CD, but is used in several publications, the full data are given: for the 30-hPa level the North Pole Temperatures are available from 1955 - 2001: "http:  dss.ucar.edu cdroms karin_labitzke_strat_grids html section1.html" Information on zonal mean data formats are available from: "http:  dss.ucar.edu cdroms karin_labitzke_strat_grids html section8.html".

TITLE: Gridded Global LGM SST and Salinity Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: The recent efforts of the paleoceanographic community have resulted in a unique set of reconstructed sea-surface temperature for the Atlantic Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum, plus estimates for the extents of glacial sea ice (Sarnthein et al. 2003). Unlike prior attempts, the contributing research groups based their data on the definition of a common LGM chronozone and used the same modern reference data for calibrating the different transfer techniques. Furthermore, the number of processed sediment cores has been vastly increased. Thus the new data is a significant advance not only with respect to quality, but also to quantity. We integrated these new data and provide monthly data sets of global sea-surface temperature and ice cover, objectively interpolated by variogram analysis and kriging to a regular 1x1 degree grid, suitable for forcing or validating numerical ocean and atmosphere models. These gridded fields are available in two flavours: The 'line' version is based on the LGM SST isolines provided by Plaumann et al. (2003), whereas the 'core' version employed the SST estimates at the individual core sites. In addition, we reconstructed sea surface salinity from the new temperature data and the available oxygen isotope measurements with three different salinity anomalies in the Weddell Sea (0, 0.55, and 1.0 salinity units)..

TITLE: Canadian Diatom Database. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Diatom Database includes two components, the first one contains approximately 5,000 diatom samples with their description, precise geographic location and associated information, and the second one consists of 1,500 entries giving information on the environmental and ecological tolerance of individual diatom species. Diatoms are powerful indicators of environmental conditions since they respond quickly to environmental changes. They are widely utilized in stratigraphic investigations.The data provides accurate, abundant and readily available information essential for the proper interpretation of any modern or fossil diatom assemblage. This key source of climate indicators provides an invaluable, long term, time series to determining climate variations in the Canadian Arctic..

TITLE: Physical and chemical evolution of atmospheric components in Antarctic troposphere. ABSTRACT: Measurements of trace components relevant to atmospheric chemistry, in gas phase such as nitric acid, nitrous acid, hydrochloric acid, bromidic acid, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, peroxyacetyl nitrate and other organic nitrates (NOy) and particulate matter such as nitrate, nitrite, chloride, bromide, sulphate, calcium, sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, were carried out at BTN (Icaro Camp) in austral summers from 1990 to 2004. Total Gaseous Mercury (TGM) and Total Particulate Matter (TPM) levels were also measured during November-December 1999 and 2000. The determinations of trace components were carried out by sampling air through a diffusion annular denuder filter patch sampling system, followed by extraction and analysis by ion chromatography. The annular denuder technique allows the simultaneous and selective collection of chemical species of interest with a precision and accuracy never achieved with other commercial instruments. In addition, this sampling technique follows a multi-step Quality Control and Assurance (QC QA) procedure, which ranges from the denuder pre-treatment to the final analysis of the data. Aerosol samples were also collected using a low-pressure impactor which divides particles into 12 size fraction over the aerodynamic particle diameter range 0.035-15.9 micrometers. After sampling, the impaction surfaces were analysed using the same procedures used for the filters and the denuders and the mass size distribution were determined. The sampling times were 12, 24 and 48h. TGM samples were taken every 24h using the manual gold trap method based on the gold-trap amalgamation technique and analysed using the CVAFS technique. TPM concentrations were obtained collecting airborne particles on micro-quartz fibre filters mounted in a quartz tube for 48h and analysed by CVAFS technique. Finally, high sensitivity instruments for nitrous acid (HONO) was tested in November and December 2003. The CNR-Institute for Atmospheric Pollution has been developed an automatic sampling system to measure HONO with two coil samplers, based on derivatization by 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and on high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis with UV detection at 309 nm. This instrument allowed the HONO measurements with a sample integration time of 3 min, with a sampling frequency of 10 min and with a detection limit of 1 pptv, proper in the polar areas. Atmospheric measurements of HONO were carried out in parallel with the micrometeorological data in order to define the local behaviours of physical parameters and to determine the surface fluxes..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Weekly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Canadian Communities Gallery - Educational Project Showcase. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Communities Gallery (CCGallery) is a service of the Atlas of Canada that provides access to the best and broadest collections of on-line educational geography and social studies projects and community web sites. The CCGallery offers a unique searchable database with an interactive mapping search result. This allows users to conduct a search by subject and geographical area and to explore this search result in an interactive mapping window. Many well-known organizations use the CCGallery to provide easy and well-defined searches of their project collections. The current contributors are: The Atlas of Canada, The Canadian Communities Atlas, Statistics Canada, Profiling Canada, SchoolNet GrassRoots, GrassRoots Communities@ca, ESRI Canada, School and Libraries Program. The CCGallery will be inviting other organizations to use this service for their own collections of on-line projects and community web sites. Our goal is to make this service the most comprehensive collection of on-line projects and web sites describing Canada. Participating Organizations All of the organizations contributing to the Canadian Communities Gallery are doing so in order to share their collections of projects and resources. Each organization's projects and resources have a unique flavour and origin but at the same time all offer something describing a part of Canada's human, economic and physical geography. Many schools combine the projects and programs offered by our contributors to provide the most comprehensive information in their on-line work. Discover Canada through school-based projects and community web sites. Here is a brief description of each organization's contribution: The Canadian Communities Atlas, part of Natural Resources Canada's Atlas of Canada, offers schools the opportunity to create an Internet-based Atlas of their community. The atlas structure is designed around physical, economic and human geographic themes. By linking students' Community Atlas projects to the Atlas of Canada, through the Canadian Communities Gallery, both local and national perspectives of many relevant geographic subjects can be accessed. Statistics Canada is the country's national statistical agency and offers quality and detailed statistical educational resources. These are organized into three broad subject matter areas: demographic and social, socio-economic and economic. Projects produced by schools making use of this information and data in projects such as Profiling Canada and others can be accessed in the Canadian Communities Gallery. The SchoolNet GrassRoots Program, together with its provincial, territorial and corporate partners, promotes academic, employability and computer skills in Canadian youth by integrating information and communication technology into learning. The GrassRoots Program offers funding to schools for the creation of innovative and interactive learning projects on the Internet. All of these projects that are geography and social studies related can be accessed in the Canadian Communities Gallery. GrassRoots Communities@ca is a national competition open to all K-12 Canadian schools. Students working with their local community create a web site to showcase the place where they live. Sites created by students will involve them in project-based learning activities, doing research within their own local communities in such areas as the arts and culture, geography, history, economic life and the environment. ESRI Canada offers schools and libraries a program using ArcView, a Geographic Information System (GIS). It brings the power of interactive mapping and analysis to everyone. ESRI Canada is dedicated to promoting the use of ArcView GIS in schools (Kindergarten to Grade 12 or OAC) and libraries as this exciting technology will allow students to explore their world in a whole new way. The Physical Geography subject categories are: geology; tectonics   seismology; gradation; climate; soil; vegetation; oceanography; hydrology and environment   land use   wildlife   pollution. The Economic Geography subject area breaks down into the following categories.

TITLE: GISP2 Atmospheric Sampling Site (ATM) Aerosols, 2 Years. ABSTRACT: This data consists of the measured aerosol concentrations from the atmospheric sampling site (ATM) during the 1993 and 1994 summer field seasons. The concentrations are in units of nanomole per cubic meter. The times in the tables are expressed as local Greenland time (i.e. Greenwich Mean Time - 2 hrs). Aerosol filter sampling was conducted during the summers of 1993 and 1994 at the solar powered remote atmospheric sampling site located 28 km southwest of the GISP2 camp (72.58N, 38.46W, 3205 m) in 1993 and 10 km southwest of the GISP2 site in 1994. Particles were collected on 90 mm Teflon Zefluor filters (1 mm pore size). The filter holders were open faced and covered with a large polyethylene bucket to prevent the collection of snow on the filter. Vacuum pumps were located in a trench beneath the surface. Airflow was measured using a Rockwell gas meter. The filters were run for approximately 16 hours each day during routine sampling periods excluding episodes of fog. During intensive sampling periods filters were changed every eight hours. In all cases, the flow rate was approximately 85 l min-1. All handling of the filters was done by personnel wearing clean room garb and shoulder length plastic gloves. Filters were removed from the filter holders in the field and stored in airtight Pyrex bottles. All filters were kept frozen until analysis at the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environement (LGGE) in Grenoble, France. In order to minimize the evaporation of volatile aerosols on the filter, extraction took place in a clean hood in a cold room at -12o C. First, 1.0 ml of ultra pure methanol was added to the bottle to wet the filter. Then 9.0 ml of deionized water were added to the bottle to dissolve the soluble particles. Secondary extractions were run on 5 of the 155 filters from the 1994 field season. The average efficiency of the primary extraction was determined to be 93% based on the amount of soluble ions in the secondary extraction. The filter extracts were analyzed by ion chromatography for fluoride, lactate, acetate, glycolate, formate, methane sulfonate, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, oxalate, sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, and calcium by ion chromatography. Detection limits for all three chemical species were calculated as 3 times the standard deviation of the amount of material on the field blanks divided by the volume of air drawn through each filter. While each filter sample had its own detection limits based on the filtered air volume, the mean aerosol concentration detection limits for 1993 and 1994 are summarized in the detection limit table. The atmospheric concentrations were calculated by subtracting the mean chemical mass on the blank filters from the mass on the sample filter..

TITLE: Ship Drift Surface Current Archive (NOO) and Subsurface Float Data (WOCE) on CD-ROM from NODC. ABSTRACT: This CD-ROM from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) contains two types of data: surface currents and subsurface float trajectories. The surface currents are from the Surface Current Data Archive of the Naval Oceanographic Office (NOO). The file contains more than 4 million observations. Most observations were obtained from the ship drift method, in which the difference between a ship's dead-reckoned position (determined from its previous position, speed and heading) and actual position (determined from a navigational fix) is ascribed solely to the effect of surface currents. The ship drift method allows indirect determinations of ocean surface currents. In addition, about 5,100 observations were taken using the Geomagnetic Electrokinetograph (GEK). These are direct instrument-measured current data. Also, surface current data summaries are provided in NODC Long Summary format. The data are summarized by Modified Canadian 10 degree square, 1 degree square, and month for all years. The subsurface float trajectories are from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Subsurface Float Data Assembly Center located at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The trajectories are derived from SOFAR (Sound Fixing and Ranging), RAFOS (SOFAR spelled backward) and ALACE (Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorer) floats. The SOFAR and RAFOS floats are ballasted for a target depth and acoustically tracked. The ALACE floats cycle vertically from a depth of neutral buoyancy to the surface where they relay to System Argos satellites. 475 float trajectories and 432 float-years of data are included. Float depths range from a few hundred meters to several thousand, with most observations falling in the 700m to 2000m depth range. Most trajectories are located in the North Atlantic with some recent observations in the Pacific and South Atlantic. The set consists of two CD-ROMS. Disk 1 contains the data, and disk2 contains the summaries. Each disk costs $55, the set $110. For more information and to order the CD-ROM set, see the NODC WWW page: "http:  www.nodc.noaa.gov" [The information in this summary was derived from NOAA's Earth System Monitor newsletter and NODC's WWW page.].

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Cumulative Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: The development of the Antarctic ice shelves during the period 1770-1950 based on expedition maps. ABSTRACT: Since about 1773 when the British captain James Cook first crossed the Antarctic Circle a vast amount of scientific data on conditions around Antarctica have been collected. Many of these data originate from the hundreds of Antarctic expeditions of exploration and commerce that have taken place. The data exist largely in the form of maps, charts and logbooks, a large number of which not only contain data about new discoveries of land, but also about the extent of ice shelves and the occurrence of sea ice and ice-bergs in the Antarctic seas. Detailed records of ice limits were kept because ice posed a great danger to the ships and prevented whalers and seal hunters from reaching their hunting grounds. At the present time, a great deal of research is being carried out into the dynamics of Antarctic ice, both causes and consequences. However, it was not until the 1950's that the systematic and long-term recording of meteorological data and ice conditions in the Antarctic region really started. This period is too short to reliably detect changes and trends in ice extent around Antarctica. By studying old maps and logs, however, the period for which data is available can be significantly extended. Although scattered in time, information from historic maps can provide valuable insight in how the present ice situation around Antarctica compares to the situation from 1800 onward. The information collected under this project is being used to compile an integrated digital dataset. Spatial information is stored and analyzed in a Geographical Information System (GIS), facilitating the systematic comparison of map data. Information from logbooks and journals are compiled in a database and linked to geographic locations or features. In this way, an overview of the dynamics of the edges of the Antarctic floating ice over the study period is being created. In this study, data covering Antarctica as a whole will be taken into account. The main focus, however, is on the Weddell Sea (Ronne and Larsen Ice Shelves) and on the Ross Sea (Ross Ice Shelf). Because of their relatively good accessibility, these areas were frequently visited and charted during commercial and scientific expeditions..

TITLE: Administrative Regions Boundaries of Europe from UNEP GRID-Geneva. ABSTRACT: [The summary was adapted from original documentation provided by UNEP GRID-Geneva] UNEP GRID Documentation Summary for Data Set: Administrative Regions Boundaries of Europe The Administrative Regions Boundaries data set shows sub-national administrative areas within the European continent. Generally speaking, the data set contains second-level administrative units for the whole of Europe, including countries outside the European Community (EC) in northern, eastern and central Europe. For the 12 member countries of the EC, the data are nearly identical with NUTS level II boundaries. The Nomenclature des Unites Territorial Statistiques is the name used by the EC to define different hierarchical administrative levels. Level II typically refers to provinces or counties. To enable incorporation of non-EC regions, a second coding system has been provided, in addition to the NUTS system. Both coding systems are included in the data set. The original coverage was provided to GRID by Eurostat in the Lambert Azimuthal projection, which is the EC standard projection. GRID has re-projected the coverage to fit the Latitude Longitude coordinate system. Furthermore, attributes supplied by Eurostat for population size, names and surface areas have been checked, edited and added to the coverage in order to assure greater consistency within the data. The resulting administrative regions map, covering a pan-European area, contains 2555 polygons for 415 regions and includes attribute data for the size, name and population for several years between 1980 and 1991. For technical reasons, the attribute data for the names have been put in a separate 'Info' file. In Arc Info uncompressed 'EXPORT' format, the coverage plus attribute data comprises 10.7 Mb of data. The coverage in Lat Long projection is called EUADMLL and the associated 'Info' file EUNAMLL.INF. These files can be read from tape to disk using Arc Info's TAPEREAD command and subsequently be imported into Arc Info using the commands: IMPORT COVER EUADMLL EUADMLL and IMPORT INFO EUNAMLL EUNAMLL.INF. The attribute file can then be joined with the polygon attribute file of the main coverage (EUADMLL.PAT) using Arc's JOINITEM command or Info's RELATE command. The item to be used for this is called EUADMLL-ID. The data set extends geographically from -24 31' 19" West to 31 36' 18" East longitude and from 27 38' 13" to 71 10' 8" North latitude. The coverage is also available in the original Lambert Azimuthal projection.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Monthly Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: ARM North Slope Alaska, Atmospheric Profiling. ABSTRACT: The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is the largest global change research program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and developing models to better understand the processes that control solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere (especially in clouds) and at the earth's surface. The URL for the ARM Data Archive is "http:  www.archive.arm.gov ". The URL for general information about the ARM program is "http:  www.arm.gov ". The data stored by the ARM Archive includes numerous parameters about radiative flux, meteorology, water vapor and clouds. The North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean (NSA AAO) site is providing data about cloud and radiative processes at high latitudes. These data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic. The NSA AAO site is centered at Barrow and extends to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (to Oliktok). Atmospheric profiling data at Barrow and Atqasuk are collected using many specialized instruments. Detailed information on each instrument is available at " http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The following list contains the instrumentation used for atmospheric profiling and the data available for the Barrow and Atqasuk sites. Microwave Radiometer (MWR). For complete MWR information, see " http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The MWR provides time-series measurements of column-integrated amounts of water vapor and liquid water. The instrument itself is essentially a sensitive microwave receiver. That is, it is tuned to measure the microwave emissions of the vapor and liquid water molecules in the atmosphere at specific frequencies. A MWR is operated at a frequency that is optimized for a particular atmospheric condition. For example, different frequencies may be used under low water vapor conditions while others may improve liquid water retrievals. At Barrow (C1), MWR data are available for 1998-01-02 to present. At Atqusk (C2), MRW data are available for 1999-10-18 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsamwrlos: water liquid and vapor along line of sight path nsamwrtip: airmasses, brightness temperatures in TIP mode nsa5mwravg: 5-minute average integrated vapor and liquid water nsaqmemwrcol: derived: QME comparing column water from MWR vs. instrument model Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Balloon-Borne Sounding System (BBSS). For complete BBSS information, see " http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The BBSS provides in-situ measurements (vertical profiles) of both the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, and the wind speed and direction, pressure (hPa), temperature (degC), and relative humidity (percent RH) are measured as functions of time during a free-balloon ascent. Secondary (derived) quantities included in the data stream, also measured as functions of time, are altitude (gpm), dew point (degC), ascent rate (m s), latitude of sonde (degN), longitude of sonde (degW), u-component of wind velocity (m s), and v-component of wind velocity (m s). At Barrow (C1), BBSS data are available for 2002-04-28 to present. ARM data stream is coded as follows: nsasondewnpn: Vaisala-processed pressure, temperature and relative humidity. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Radar Wind Profiler and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) (RWP915). For complete RWP915 information, see " http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The RWP915 measures wind profiles from (nominally) 0.1 km to 5 km and virtual temperature profiles from 0.1 km to 1.5 km. It operates by transmitting electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere and measuring the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Virtual temperatures are recovered by transmitting an acoustic signal vertically and measuring the electromagnetic energy scattered from the acoustic wavefront. The propagation speed of the acoustic wave is proportional to the square root of the virtual temperature. The primary quantities measured with the system are the intensity and Doppler frequency of backscattered radiation. The wind speed is determined from the Doppler frequency of energy scattered from refractive index fluctuations (caused primarily by moisture fluctuations but also by temperature fluctuations) embedded within the atmosphere; the virtual temperature is determined from the Doppler frequency of microwave energy scattered from acoustic energy propagating through the atmosphere. RWP915 data at Barrow (C1) is available for 2001-04-01 to present. ARM data streams for temperature are coded as follows: 915rwptempcon: temperature profile data 915rwptempmom: temperature profile data 915rwptempspec: temperature profile data Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. ARM data streams for wind are coded as follows: 915rwpwindcon: wind profile data 915rwpwindmom: wind profile data 915rwpwindspec: wind profile data Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Yearly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: ARCTIC TUNDRA FLUX STUDY IN THE KUPARUK RIVER BASIN (ALASKA), 1994-1996. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: CO2 and water vapor fluxes and ecosystem characteristics were measured at 24 sites along a 317-km transect from the Arctic coast to the latitudinal treeline in Alaska during the growing seasons of 1994-1996. The sites were stratified to sample the ranges of climate, physiography, soil moisture, and vegetation type within the region. Our main objective was to understand what factors control variations in CO2 and water vapor exchange across the region. We therefore developed a spatially extensive approach of documenting fluxes for 1-2 weeks at each of the sites in order to study as many sites as possible during the middle of the short arctic growing season, when plant phenology is most comparable among different vegetation types and climatic regions. This allowed us to compare, with some replication, a given vegetation type across different provinces and climatic zones, as well as multiple vegetation types within a given geographic area..

ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Canadian Sea Ice Atlas from Microwave Remotely Sensed Imagery. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Sea Ice Atlas from Microwave Remotely Sensed Imagery was one of Canada's contributions to the United Nations International Space Year (ISY)-1992. The Sea Ice Atlas was funded by the Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) [now Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC)] Canadian Climate Centre, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Institute for Space and Terrestrial Science (ISTS), and private industry. The sea ice atlas consists of monthly total sea ice concentrations from July 1987 to June 1990 using data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) instrument on the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) polar orbiting satellites. The sea ice concentration was derived using the AES York sea ice concentration algorithm. The satellite maps are presented in two formats: for each month, the total sea ice concentration is shown with a color scheme that roughly parallels the color spectrum from red (100% ice cover) to blue (0% ice cover). For the months of February and September, which represent the maximum and minimum sea ice extent, a second representation is shown in which per cent ice cover by category is shown. The categories are thin ice, first-year ice and multi-year ice.

TITLE: USGS Geologic Map of North America. ABSTRACT: The Geologic Map of North America (published February 2005) portrays the grand architecture of the continent as we understood it in the closing years of the 20th century. As the final product of the Geological Society of America's Decade of North American Geology project, it was compiled by John C. Reed, Jr. (USGS), John O. Wheeler (Geological Survey of Canada), and Brian E. Tucholke (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). The map is at a scale of 1:5,000,000 and covers about 15% of the Earth's surface. The previous geologic map of North America (North American Geologic Map Committee, 1965) was published before general acceptance of plate tectonics, before radiometric dates were widely available, and when the geology of the sea floors was largely unknown. The old map distinguished about 100 rock units, all of them onshore. The new map distinguishes 939 units, of which 142 are offshore. It also depicts many geologic features not shown on the previous map, including volcanoes, calderas, impact structures, axes of submarine canyons, spreading centers, transform faults, magnetic isochrons, and subduction zones. For the first time it portrays the relationships between the geology of the continent and the geology of the ocean basins that flank it. The map was compiled over an interval of almost 25 years and its assembly spanned the technological change from traditional cartography to digital cartography. Although the map is not yet available in digital form, plans are underway for construction of a digital database and ultimately for the release of GIS compatible files.

TITLE: Siberian Mapping Project. ABSTRACT: The purpose of the Siberian Mapping Project is to improve forest cover maps and create above ground biomass maps of the Siberian boreal forest. The project is aimed at improving forest disturbance detection methods, studying the tundra-taiga ecotone, differentiating between natural and human-caused disturbance mechanism and mapping boreal forest structure using the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite data. The boreal forest in the Earth's largest terrestrial biome, covering some 12 million square km and accounting for about one third of this planet's total forest areas. Mapping of boreal forest's type, biomass, and other structural parameters are critical for understanding the boreal forest's significance in the carbon cycle, its response to and impact on global climate change.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Seasonal Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships. For more detailed information, see the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for MODIS Detached Coccolith Concentration http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod23.pdf The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Calcite (CLCT) data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA L3SMI .

TITLE: UARS Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) Level 2 V001 (UARHA2FN) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: The HALOE home page on the WWW is http:  haloe.gats-inc.com home index.php The Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) investigates upper atmosphere chemistry, dynamics and radiative processes, particlarly stratospheric ozone destruction and chlorofluromethane impact on ozone. HALOE is a solar occultation experiment designed to monitor the vertical distribution of HCl, HF, CH4, and NO by gas filter correlation radiometry and H2O, NO2, O3, and CO2 by broadband filter radiometry. The HALOE instrument typically views 15 sunrise and sunset events each day, scanning the solar disk from limb to limb during each event. The latitude longitude location of the HALOE data varies with the spacecraft-Earth-Sun position. For a given day, the locations tend to be in two distinct latitude bands and to sweep across the full longitude range. Coverage across the full range of latitudes is achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six weeks depending on the time of year. The latitude coverage extends from 80 degrees north to 80 degrees south. The HALOE level 3AT data consist of 13 granules per day. A data granule is one HALOE species or subtype per day. The following subtypes are available: 1) AEXTCH4 - aerosol extinction at 3.46 um (CH4 gas filter), 2) AEXTCO2 - aerosol extinction at 2.80 um (CO2 gas filter), 3) AEXTHCL - aerosol extinction at 3.40 um (HCL gas filter), 4) AEXTHF - aerosol extinction at 2.45 um (HF gas filter), 5) AEXTNO - aerosol extinction at 5.26 um (NO gas filter), 6) CH4 - methane, 7) H2O - water vapor, 8) HCL - hydrogen chloride, 9) HF - hydrogen fluoride, 10) NO - nitric oxide, 11) NO2 - nitrogen dioxide, 12) O3 - ozone, and 13) TEMP - atmospheric temperature. Aerosol extinction coefficients are measured in units of 1 km, chemical species are given in parts per million by volume (ppmv), and temperature is in units of degrees Kelvin. Each of the 13 HALOE granules is accompanied by 2 additional parameter files, designated as level 3TP. The first parameter file, subtype LAT, contains the latitude values for each pressure level of each event for the day. The second parameter file, subtype LON, contains the longitude values. The level 3AT files only contain the latitude longitude location corresponding to the 30 km retrieval point. The HALOE level 3AT data product consist of profiles that have been interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS project for all limb-viewing instruments. The level 3AT format is common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison. The level 3AT data product consists of time-ordered profiles, and are spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or about 495 km along the tangent track (horizontal resolution). The vertical resolution for the level 3AT HALOE profiles is defined by the UARS pressure levels (in mbars) given by: P(i) = 1000 * 10**(-i 6) for i = 0, 1, 2, ... which gives approximately 2.5 km increments between pressure surfaces..

TITLE: Snow Melt Onset Over Arctic Sea Ice from SMMR and SSM I Brightness Temperatures. ABSTRACT: Yearly snow melt onset dates over Arctic sea ice are derived from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) brightness temperatures. The introduction of liquid water to snow results in a sharp increase in the emissivity and hence brightness temperature of the snowpack. Snow melt onset is defined as the point in time when microwave brightness temperatures increase sharply due to the presence of liquid water in the snowpack. Data cover the years 1979 through 1998, and are in a polar stereographic grid at 25 km resolution. Tab-delimited ASCII files and GIF images are accessible via ftp.

TITLE: Diagnostic For Magnitude Of Tropical Cooling At Last Glacial Maximum. ABSTRACT: The LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis was used as a diagnostic by Pinot et al. (1999) and in the IPCC (2001). An updated version of this diagram was presented by Harrison (2000). In this diagram, the uppermost histogram shows the frequency of reconstructed temperature changes, based on terrestrial data, at the elevation of the individual sites colour-coded by region (Central and South America, circum-Indian, Western Pacific). The histogram at the right shows the frequency of reconstructed sea-surface temperature changes, based on alkenone data from the TEMPUS data set (Rosell-Melé et al., 1998), colour-coded by ocean basin (Pacific, Atlantic, Indian). To use this graphic for diagnostic purposes, the simulated change in temperature over land and ocean should be plotted. This could be the zonal mean, or regional averages for the land areas ocean basins distinguished for the observations. The line drawn on the graph represents the zonal mean sea-surface temperature calculated from the CLIMAP (1981) gridded data set, for comparison..

TITLE: Psychological surveys and interviews of visitors to Antarctica over three phases of their journey. ABSTRACT: Visitors to Antarctica (Ross Sea Region) were examined via survey and questionnaires over three phases of their experience; 1) anticipation of the visit, 2) during the on-site visit and 3) upon return home after the visit. This method was used on different groups of visitors with the aim to examine a cycle of experience, comparing groups of visitors through this cycle and analysing for change or transition as a result. Data was obtained by the author upon visiting the Ross Sea in the 2003 2004 season and supplemented with data from the 2002 2003 season and surveys completed by passengers aboard the tourist vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov of Quark Expeditions. The research examines the mindset and experience of visitors who come into physical contact with the continent but do not achieve or help to achieve scientific results..

TITLE: ARM North Slope Alaska, Cloud Measurements. ABSTRACT: The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is the largest global change research program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and developing models to better understand the processes that control solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere (especially in clouds) and at the earth's surface. The URL for the ARM Data Archive is "http:  www.archive.arm.gov ". The URL for general information about the ARM program is "http:  www.arm.gov ". The data stored by the ARM Archive includes numerous parameters about radiative flux, meteorology, water vapor and clouds. The North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean (NSA AAO) site is providing data about cloud and radiative processes at high latitudes. These data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic. The NSA AAO site is centered at Barrow and extends to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (to Oliktok). Cloud measurements at Barrow and Atqasuk use many specialized instruments. Detailed information on each instrument is available at "http:  www.arm.gov docs instruments.html". The following list contains the instrumentation used to monitor clouds and the data available for the Barrow (C1) and Atqasuk (C2) sites. Vaisala Ceilometer (VCEIL). For complete VCEIL information, visit "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The VCEIL is a self-contained, ground-based, active, remote-sensing device designed to measure cloud-base height at up to three levels and potential backscatter signals by aerosols. Model CT25K has a maximum vertical range of 25,000 feet. The ceilometer transmits near-infrared pulses of light, and the receiver telescope detects the light scattered back by clouds and precipitation. The Vaisala ceilometers measure the backscattered light intensity from a pulsed InGaAs diode laser (905 nm) as a function of distance (15-m resolution for the CT25K). These measurements are used to produce derived products that are recorded. These products include (1) The backscatter profile with 15-m resolution; (2) The cloud-bottom height determined with an algorithm to define cloud bottom as the height corresponding to a visibility reduction to 100 m; (3) Secondary cloud-bottom heights from a cloud above the lowest cloud; and (4) Tertiary cloud-bottom heights from an even higher cloud. VCEIL data at Barrow are available for 1997-12-11 to present. At Atqusck, the data are available for 1999-08-22 to present. ARM data stream is coded as follows: nsavceil25k: cloud base heights, 25,000 feet maximum range. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Millimeter Wave Cloud Radar (MMCR). For complete MMCR information, visit "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The MMCR systems probe the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The MMCR is a zenith-pointing radar that operates at a frequency of 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine cloud boundaries (e.g., cloud bottoms and tops). This radar will also report radar reflectivity (dBZ) of the atmosphere up to 20 km. The radar possesses a doppler capability that will allow the measurement of cloud constituent vertical velocities. The primary quantities measured with this system are (1) radar doppler spectra, (2) radar doppler moments, (3) radar reflectivity (dBZ), (4) vertical velocity, and (5) spectral width. Inversions are in development to infer cloud microphysical properties. At Barrow (C1), MWR data are available from 1998-01-02 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsammcrmomentsC1: moments data nsammcrmonC1: moments data nsammcrpowC1: power data nsammcrcalC1: calibration data nsammcrmode01v0091clothC1: Drived: MMCR Mode 1 (stratus mode) moments nsammcrmode02v0061clothC1: Derived: MMCR Mode 2 (cirrus mode) moments nsammcrmode03v0081clothC1: Derived: MMCR Mode 3 (general mode) moments nsammcrmode04v0061clothC1: Derived: MMCR Mode 4 (robust mode) moments Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. The Micropulse Lidar (MPL). For complete MPL information, visit "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The MPL is a ground-based optical remote sensing system designed primarily to determine the altitude of clouds overhead and provides information on cloud base (thick clouds), cloud base and top (optically thin clouds) and an aerosol profile. The physical principle is the same as for radar. A pulse of energy is transmitted and the energy reflected back is measured. From the time delay between the transmitted pulse and the backscattered signal, the distance to the scatterer is inferred. Besides real-time detection of clouds, post-processing can also characterize the extent of the tropospheric mixing layer (the planetary boundary layer), or other particle-laden regions. This eye-safe system is designed for continuous operation. The Micropulse Lidar (MPL) has one measurement channel that records backscatter signals in 300 meter range bins, with the lowest valid range bin beginning at 120 meters above ground level, up to 20+ kilometers. The primary quantity obtained from this signal is the real-time reporting of the lowest detected cloud base in meters, obtained from 60 sec averages. Additional quantities possible through post-processing of the raw signal return include a relative backscatter profile (counts sec meter) with instrument effects removed. Instrument effects include a dead-time correction specific to the individual detector, near-range corrections for the overlap of the transmitting and detection optics, and removal of afterpulsing due to detector saturation from optical crosstalk as the pulse is transmitted. From the relative backscatter profile, other data products are possible. These include cloud boundaries, multiple cloud decks, and layer boundaries. At Barrow (C1), MPL data are available from 1998-05-21 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsamplC1: cloud base and top heights nsamplcmask1clothC1: MPL cloud mask using the first Clothiaux, et al. Algorithm nsamplsmask1clothC1: MPL significance mask using the first Clothiaux, et al. Significance Algorithm. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Microwave Radiometer (MWR). For complete MWR information, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The MWR provides time-series measurements of column-integrated amounts of water vapor and liquid water. The instrument itself is essentially a sensitive microwave receiver. That is, it is tuned to measure the microwave emissions of the vapor and liquid water molecules in the atmosphere at specific frequencies. The MWR receives microwave radiation from the sky at 23.8 GHz and 31.4 GHz. These two frequencies allow simultaneous determination of water vapor and liquid water burdens along a selected path. Atmospheric water vapor observations are made at the hinge point of the emission line where the vapor emission does not change with altitude (pressure). Cloud liquid in the atmosphere emits in a continuum that increases with frequency, dominating the 31.4 GHz observation, whereas water vapor dominates the 23.8-GHz channel. The water vapor and liquid water signals can, therefore, be separated by observing at these two frequencies. At Barrow (C1), MWR data are available for 1998-01-02 to present. At Atqusk (C2), MRW data are available for 1999-10-18 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsamwrlos: water liquid and vapor along line of sight path nsamwrtip: airmasses, brightness temperatures in TIP mode nsa5mwravg: 5-minute average integrated vapor and liquid water nsaqmemwrcol: Derived: QME comparing column water from MWR vs. instrument model Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Whole-Sky Imager (WSI). For complete information on the WSI, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The WSI is an automated imager used for assessing and documenting cloud fields and cloud field dynamics. The WSI is a ground-based electronic imaging system that monitors the upper hemisphere. It is a passive, i.e., non-emissive, system that acquires images of the sky dome through three spectral filters (neutral, red, and blue). From these sky images, we can assess the presence, distribution, shape, and radiance of clouds over the entire sky using automated cloud decision algorithms and related processing. The present WSI model (EO System 6) is capable of image acquisition under daylight, moonlight, and starlight conditions. The WSI measures the sky radiance in approximately 1 3 degree increments over the entire sky dome. The measurements are made in two narrow spectral regions centered at 650 nm and 450 nm. The sky radiances are acquired as two 16-bit images and are used to determine the presence of opaque clouds and thin clouds in the line of sight on a pixel-by-pixel basis. These cloud data are used to calculate the cloud cover and statistical quantities. At Barrow (C1), WSI data are available for 1998-10-19 to present. At Atqusk (C2), WSI data are available for 2001-09-14 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsawsicloud: Derived: cloud numbers, area, perimeter, and more from the WSI nsawsicloudsummary: cloud and aerosol information, classification summary data nsawsifullradiance: calibrated radiances for each pixel, with multiple filters nsawsipatchsummary: radiances from red image for three patches (average and standard deviation). Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Active Remote Sensing Cloud Layer (ARSCL). For Barrow (C1) there are two additional data streams that use data from the Belfort laser ceilometer (BLC), MPL, and MMCR. The BLC was replaced by the VCEIL in 2000. For information on the BCL, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". ARSCL data are available for 1998-11-01 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsaarsclbnd1cloth: cloud boundaries from first Clothiaux algorithms on BLC, MPL, MMCR nsaarsclcbh1cloth: cloud base height from first Clothiaux algorithms on BLC, MPL, MMCR Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future..

TITLE: GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 Monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V001 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah 2.7.1 model in the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The data are in 1.0 degree resolution and range from 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. This simulation was forced by combination of NOAA GDAS atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency&#039;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET). The simulation was initialized on 1 January 1979 using soil moisture and other state fields from a GLDAS Noah model climatology for that day of the year. WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The following table shows a list of parameters, their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units.

TITLE: Monthly average polar sea-ice concentration. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this data set is to provide paleoclimate researchers with a tool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea-ice concentration in the modern polar oceans and for estimating the modern monthly sea-ice concentration at any given polar oceanic location. It is expected that these data will be compared with paleoclimate data derived from geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable-isotope analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general circulation models of climate change. This data set represents the results of calculations carried out on sea-ice-concentration data from the SMMR and SSM I instruments. The original data were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The data set also contains the source code of the programs that made the calculations. The objective was to derive monthly averages for the whole 13.25-year series (1978-1991) and to derive a composite series of monthly averages representing the variation of an average year. The resulting file set contains monthly images for each of the polar regions for each year, yielding 160 files for each pole, and composite monthly averages in which the years are combined, yielding 12 more files. Averaging the images in this way tends to reduce the number of grid cells that lack valid data; the composite averages are designed to suppress interannual variability. Also included in the data set are programs that can retrieve seasonal ice-concentration profiles at user-specified locations. These nongraphical data retrieval programs are provided in versions for UNIX, extended DOS, and Macintosh computers. Graphical browse utilities are included for the same computing platforms but require more sophisticated display systems. The data contained in this data set are derived from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave  Imager (SSM I) data produced by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado in cooperation with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The basic data come from satellites of the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. NSIDC distributes three collections of sea- ice-concentration grids on CD-ROM: data from the Nimbus-7 SMMR (October 25, 1978 through August 20, 1987) are provided on volume 7 of the SMMR Polar Data series (NASA, 1992); data from the SSM I are provided on two separate volumes, covering the periods from July 9 of 1987 to December 31 of 1989, and from January 1 of 1990 through December 31 of 1991, respectively. The NASATEAM data from revision 2 of the SSM I CD-ROM's were used to create the present data set. SMMR images were collected every 2 to 3 days, whereas SSM I data are provided in daily ice-concentration grids. Apart from a number of small gaps (5 or fewer days) in the record, the only long period for which no data are available is December 3 of 1987 through January 12 of 1988, inclusive. As ancillary data, the ETOPO5 global gridded elevation and bathymetry data (Edwards, 1989) were interpolated to the resolution of the NSIDC data; the interpolated topographic data are included. The images are provided in three formats: Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), a flexible scientific data format developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications; Graphics Interchange Format (GIF); and Macintosh PICT format. The ice- concentration grids are distributed by NSIDC in HDF format..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Monthly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: Southeast Atlantic Alkenone Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) determined in core TN057-21-PC2 (41°089S, 7°499E; 4981 m water depth) by the alkenone paleotemperature technique using previously established protocols (Sachs and Lehman 1999, Science 286, 756) and the temperature calibration of Prahl et al. 1998 (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 52, 2303) Age model from Stoner et al (2000), EPSL, Vol. 183: 161-177. Abstract: A detailed record of sea surface temperature from sediments of the Cape Basin in the subtropical South Atlantic indicates a previously undocumented progression of marine climate change between 41 and 18 thousand years before the present (ky B.P.), during the last glacial period. Whereas marine records typically indicate a long-term cooling into the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21 ky B.P.) consistent with gradually increasing global ice volume, the Cape Basin record documents an interval of substantial temperate ocean warming from 41 to 25 ky B.P. The pattern is similar to that expected in response to changes in insolation owing to variations in Earth's tilt..

TITLE: Canadian Geothermal Data Collection: Deep Permafrost Temperatures and Thickness of Permafrost. ABSTRACT: Precision temperature measurements have been made in some 150 deep wells and holes drilled in the course of natural resource exploration in the permafrost regions of Northern Canada. In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a regions of Northern Canada. In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a thermistor incrementally down the well, in other cases multi-thermistor cables were left in the holes and periodic measurements taken. In the 1990's, a few holes were logged by a automatic quasi- continuous logging system. Most holes were logged annually for 5-10 years after drilling completion, and measured temperatures show the disturbance due to drilling and the gradual recovery to near-undisturbed conditions. Some holes in the collection are of depth less than 125 m. Permafrost thicknesses are estimated at each well or hole from the depth of the 0 degree Celsius isotherm. This data collection provides the highest quality of permafrost temperature and permafrost thickness information available for Northern Canada. Other data are the large number of downhole temperature and permafrost thickness estimates taken during commercial well logging of petroleum exploration wells, and are by nature of lesser quality. These data are not included in this data set, but references to compilations of this data are provided. A short text (2000 words), tables of site locations and permafrost thicknesses with small-scale maps, and an extensive bibliography accompany the data collection. The file structure and contents of each file are well described. The text is sufficient to locate the data of interest, and the file description is adequate for a user to recover the parameters of interest. The data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998..

TITLE: RADARSAT Ortho-rectified Mosaic of Canada, Lambert Conformal Conic, 500 Metres. ABSTRACT: The Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) have collaborated with contributions from RADARSAT International (RSI), to create an ortho-rectified RADARSAT-1 mosaic of Canada. Using CSA's RADARSAT data archive, ScanSAR Narrow B descending mode data were selected. The majority of the data, south of 60 degrees was acquired during the growing seasons of 1998 and 1999. The remaining data were collected during the winters of 1998 and 1999. A digital national mosaic has been produced at a 500m pixel spacing, in a Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection. That data set is available here.

A composite chronology derived from these data correlates positively and significantly with summer temperatures at Nome from 1910-1970, after which there is some loss of positive temperature response. There is inferred cooling during periods within the Little Ice Age (LIA) from the early to middle 1600s and late 1700s to middle 1800s; and warming from the middle 1600s to early 1700s. We also present a larger composite data set covering AD 978-2001, utilizing the SP ring width data in combination with archaeological wood measurements and other recent collections from northwestern Alaska. The Regional Curve Standardization (RCS) method was employed to maximize potential low-frequency information in this data-set. The RCS chronology shows intervals of persistent above-average growth around the time of the "Medieval Warm Period" (MWP) early in the millennium, which are comparable to growth levels in recent centuries. There is a more sustained cold interval during the LIA inferred from the RCS record as compared to the SP ring width series. The chronologies correlate significantly with Bering and Chukchi Sea sea surface temperatures and with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. These atmosphere-ocean linkages probably account for the differences between these records and large-scale reconstructions of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere temperatures based largely on continental interior proxy data.

MSL12 is used for the standard processing of all ocean products distributed through the ocean color web browsers and ftp sites. This software is capable of retrieving oceanic optical properties and various derived products from the observed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances collected by a variety of ocean remote sensing radiometers, including MODIS. Full documentation, updated code source, sensor files, and output product descriptions can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MSL12  Earth Probe-TOMS Ancillary Ozone data are global ozone data files in Hierarchical Data Format that are created from Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer data for atmospheric correction in routine data processing. The data files are primarily employed for the processing of Level 1A data to Level 2. The data files are global data files collected twice daily. Ancillary Ozone Data from TOVS (the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) are data files in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) that can be used for routine data processing in the atmospheric correction step. The TOVS data serve as a backup ozone data source to ozone data from EP-TOMS. The data files are created from TOVS data files provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). TOVS is an instrument on the NOAA Polar-Orbiting satellite platforms. The optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is produced weekly on a one-degree grid. The analysis uses in situ and satellite SST's plus SST's simulated by sea-ice cover. Before the analysis is computed, the satellite data is adjusted for biases using the method of Reynolds (1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993). The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas and the Great Lakes. There is no analysis over land. See the README file at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov OISST README for additional information..

TITLE: The Second Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE-II) on CD-ROM. ABSTRACT: This CD-ROM contains the final data pertaining to the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition II (AASE-II) which was based in Bangor, Maine between October 1991 and March 1992, with ER-2 flights from Ames Research Center, Moffett Field (California), Fairbanks (Alaska), and Bangor (Maine), along with and DC-8 flights from Ames, Bangor, Anchorage (Alaska), Stavanger (Norway), and Tahiti. The data consist of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, ozonesonde soundings from six Canadian stations, global grid point values of Nimbus 7 TOMS ozone, and selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the region of the experiment. Theory teams provided calculations of potential vorticity, temperature, geopotential, horizontal winds, parcel back trajectories, and concentrations of short lived species along the aircraft flight tracks; and northern hemispheric analyses of potential vorticity, temperature, geopotential, horizontal winds, and radiative heating rates. All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable length records terminated by a carriage return line feed pair (<CR><LF>, ASCII decimal values 13 and 10). Therefore, MS-DOS users should be able to read them as they are, but UNIX and MAC users will have to strip off either the <CR> or the <LF> from each line to convert them to standard UNIX or MAC files. Commercially available software, such as dos2unix and Apple File Exchange, exists to convert MS-DOS files to both UNIX and MAC files. VMS users can define the files to have STREAM record formats. In general, the file naming convention uses a two-character prefix to identify the measurement, followed by a six digit number (yymmdd) giving the year, month, and day (UT) of the flight, balloon launch, or model result. To identify the measurement platform, a three character extension of EA1, DA1, Bhh, or Ghh is used to denote the data is from the ER-2, DC-8, balloon, or grid point model output (hh denotes the UT hour of balloon launch or model result). Exceptions to this convention are the SFyymmdd.Enn files which use the extensions E00, E01, E05, E30 to denote aerosol loading factors; the TOMS data files which have the extensions N7; and the chemical modelling result MA911006.H00. The NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft and balloons were employed to carry a suite of instruments into the lower stratosphere. Many of these were used in the 1989 AASE-I. New instruments included a gas chromatograph to measure CFC-11, a diode laser spectrometer to measure CH4, N2O, and HCL, and spectrometers to measure in situ CO, CH4, N2O, and CO2. The ER-2 was deployed from Ames Research Center, California (37N, 122W), to Fairbanks, Alaska (65N, 147W) in October 1991, so that air could be observed at the highest possible latitudes before it was incorporated into the forming polar vortex. In November 1991, the ER-2 was moved to Bangor, Maine (45N, 69W) where it would have a high probability of encountering air in the arctic vortex, but could still have acceptable weather for aircraft operations. The ER-2 missions involved flights to Greenland, 20N, 25N, 55N, 65N, 70N, 85N, and 90N. The DC-8 missions involved flights to Tahiti, Norway, Wyoming, 15N, 20N, 65N, and 90N. On March 11, 1992, a balloon launched from Greenland (67.0N, 50.6W) carried instruments to measure O3, NO, and CLO. The objective of the balloon launch was to extend the aircraft measurements to higher latitudes. The Canadian Ozone Experiment (CANOZE-7) launched balloons from December 1991 to March 1992 from Alert, Canada (82N, 62W). The nitric acid measurements made from these balloons are also reported here. The AASE-II data set provides the first seasonal perspective on polar ozone chemistry in the northern hemisphere. It also provides the first detailed investigations of the chemistry occurring on volcanic sulfuric acid aerosols. The data show clearly the important counterbalance between dynamical resupply of ozone in the arctic vortex and ongoing chemical destruction. The aircraft measurements also show the important role of nitrogen oxides, produced by nitric acid photolysis, in destroying CLO after temperatures become too high for polar stratospheric clouds to form. These results highlight the fact that large ozone losses in the arctic spring require either extensive denitrification of the vortex, which could occur if temperatures fell below that at which ice clouds form, or long lasting polar stratospheric clouds, that will occur if temperatures remain low enough for nitric acid to condense for extended periods of time. Neither extremely low temperatures, with extensive denitrification, nor a prolonged period of low temperatures occurred in 1992. Therefore, although very high levels of CLO were present in the arctic vortex in January 1992, the ozone loss that occurred was limited by the rapid decline of CLO in February. Other winters, such as 1992-1993, which had much more persistent low temperatures, may have conditions more conducive to significant ozone loss. It is also clear from the AASE-II data set that volcanic aerosols do significantly perturb stratospheric chemistry. However, some of the reactions are saturated at aerosol surface areas only slightly greater that ambient, and others depend strongly on temperature. Therefore, an assessment of the impact of the Pinatubo eruption on global ozone requires careful treatment of the entire thermal, dynamical, aerosol and chemical evolution of the stratosphere..

TITLE: North American Bird Banding Retrieval Files. ABSTRACT: Purpose: Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of facilitating migratory bird research in North America. Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to help set federal hunting regulations. In addition, many states and provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game and nongame studies. Both banding and encounter data can be combined with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival, mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters. Abstract: The Banding Retrieval File contains summarized records for data through the last full calendar year for all game birds banded since 1908, and for all nongame birds banded since 1954. A summary record includes all birds of the same species, age and sex, with the same status and additional information codes, banded under the same permit number, within the same region and 10-minute block of latitude and longitude, during the same month and 5-day banding period, the same band type, and band number prefix. Supplementary Information: The Banding Retrieval File contains over 9 million records representing over 50 million birds processed through August 1995. The file increases by approximately 1.2 million birds each year. Data are displayed in the following order: species number, region, year, permit, month, day code, status and additional information, age, sex, latitude, longitude, direction code, prefix and part of band suffix, total number of birds. A file format is included with all disks to assist the user in separating the fields. Listings have the fields separated and identified. The numerical codes in the data can be translated with the aid of the Bird Banding Manual, vol. 1 part 5 (described in the section 1.15 Cross Reference). Status code in the first column indicates that something was done to the bird upon recapture that changed the original status. Geographic Description: Includes range of North American species. Range includes breeding, wintering and migration locations. Wintering ranges can include South America, Africa, Europe. Breeding can occur as far north as the Arctic. However, the species being studied are North American species. http:  www.pwrc.usgs.gov bbl .

TITLE: Biochemical characterization of the antioxidant system in the scallop Adamussium colbecki, a sentinel organism for monitoring the antarctic environment.. ABSTRACT: The scallop Adamussium colbecki can be profitably used for monitoring Antarctic coast environments but its utility would be increased if chemical analysis of pollutants were integrated with data on their biological effects. Since oxidative stress is a common pathway of toxicity induced by xenobiotics, a biochemical characterization was carried out on the antioxidant system of this species and baseline data collected for future assessment of the anthropogenic impact in this remote area. The digestive gland and gills were investigated for the levels of glutathione and the activity of several glutathione-dependent and antioxidant enzymes: glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, glutathione S-transferases, Se-dependent and Se-independent glutathione peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutase. Moreover, the Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) against three potent oxidants was also measured in the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of the digestive gland. The dataset also contain measurements of the seasonal variations of the susceptibility to oxidative stress during the spring and summer months..

TITLE: Coring Data from Drained Thaw-Lake Basins of the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. ABSTRACT: This data set includes measurements and observations taken from drained thaw-lake basin (DTLB) cores retrieved from Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska in April and August of 2001 through 2003. Investigators selected young, medium, old, and ancient DTLBs to collect data from by surveying their vegetation. DTLBs become sites for the accumulation of organic carbon as peat deposits. With this research, investigators aimed to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered in drained basins, supplement current knowledge of the basic processes governing these important elements of the northern Alaskan landscape, and provide new information on landscape-scale response to climate change.

TITLE: AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 1.25 km EASE-Grid Composites. ABSTRACT: The AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 1.25 km EASE-Grid Composites are a collection of products for both poles, consisting of twice-daily gridded and calibrated satellite channel data and derived parameters. Data include five Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) channels, clear sky surface broadband albedo and skin temperature, solar zenith angle, satellite elevation angle, sun-satellite relative azimuth angle, surface type mask, cloud mask, orbit mask, time of acquisition, and ice motion vectors. Data are composited onto two grids per day based on common local solar times and scan angle. Reduced-resolution data (25 km) derived from the 1.25 km data are available to assist users in selecting these data. AVHRR local area coverage (LAC) and High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) level 1b data are used to generate the Polar Pathfinder products at grid spacings of 1.25 km. AVHRR Polar Pathfinder data extend poleward from 48.4 degrees north and 53.2 degrees south latitudes, from August 1993 through December 1998 for the Northern Hemisphere, and from April 1992 through January 1996 for the Southern Hemisphere. Data are in 1-byte and 2-byte integer grid format. Ice motion vectors are in ASCII text format. Data are available on 8-mm tape or by ftp. Distribution formats available: North: 104 MB (2-byte), 52 MB (1-byte), 8 MB (ice motion) South: 82 MB (2-byte), 41 MB (1-byte), 6.3 MB (ice motion). <h2 class='newsdate'>Please note that the machine on which these AVHRR data are processed has reached its life expectancy and will no longer be available as of 02 June 2008 until further notice.< h2>.

TITLE: European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment (EASOE). ABSTRACT: he European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment (EASOE) was undertaken in the northern winter of 1991-92 to study the processes in the Arctic which lead to ozone destruction and their connection with reduced ozone at northern mid-latitudes. The data from the campaign has been made available on CD-ROM by the Norwegian Institude for Air Research (NILU). The CDs are held at the BADC. This two CD-ROM set contains measurements made from 16 ground stations throughout Europe, flights made by the three aircraft involved in the campaign, numerous stratospheric balloons launched from Kiruna in northern Sweden and from ozonesondes from 22 European stations. In addition data from the total ozone monitoring network and from the TOMS and TOVS satellite instruments are included. This data is complemented by meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts and from the UK Met. Office. The parameters measured include concentrations of ozone and the members of the chlorine and nitrogen families which are involved in the photochemical destruction of ozone, aerosol and PSC extinctions and meteorological parameters used to study transport into and out of the polar vortex. The EASOE campaign coincided with the NASA AASE-II aircraft campaign and this dataset is also available from the BADC. [Extracted from the EASOE home Page].

TITLE: Freeze-Thaw Earth System Data Record. ABSTRACT: NASA's Freeze Thaw Earth System Data Record (FT-ESDR) Web Interface is a NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) funded effort to provide a consistent long-term global data record of land surface freeze thaw (FT) state dynamics for all vegetated regions where low temperatures are a major constraint to ecosystem processes. The FT measurement is derived from temporal change classification of global satellite microwave remote sensing time series, including passive microwave radiometry from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), and radar scatterometry from SeaWinds-on-QuikSCAT. The ecological significance and basis of the FT measurement from satellite microwave remote sensing is summarized in the literature (e.g., see "Relevant Publications" section below). The FT-ESDR is designed to: 1) distinguish FT heterogeneity in accordance with mesoscale climate and landscape topographic features; 2) establish biophysical linkages between FT processes and vegetation productivity, respiration and associated land-atmosphere carbon exchange; 3) distinguish FT dynamics in accordance with episodic weather events, annual anomalies, periodic climate cycles and long-term climate change trajectories."

TITLE: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUVs) Data from Coastal Ocean Observation Lab at Rutgers University. ABSTRACT: The Coastal Ocean Observation Lab at Rutgers University Institute of Marine & Coastal Sciences (IMCS) and Webb Research Corporation are currently focusing on the development and deployment of a fleet of gliders to continuously patrol the coastal oceans. The instruments, combined with the mobility and long-range communication capabilities of the glider, are providing continuous, near real time information on ocean physics and biology. Beginning in November 2003, a single glider has been deployed each month with the task of patrolling the New Jersey Shelf Observing Systems ENDURANCE LINE. The Endurance Line begins about ~5km southwest of the Rutgers University Marine Field Station and runs offshore to the continental shelf break, approximately 120 km. Mission durations range from 2 - 4 weeks, depending on the instrument package, and have allowed the COOL lab to begin building a historical database on the physics and biology of the New Jersey Shelf..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Monthly Climatology Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html SeaWiFS acquires approximately 15 pole-to-pole orbital swaths of data per day, and approximately 90% of the ocean surface is scanned every two days. Visible and near infrared raw radiance counts are collected (Level 1A data) and are converted to geophysical parameters (Level 2 data). Level 3 (9 km) data processing involves both temporal and spatial binning and utilizes Level 2 Global Area Coverage (GAC) (4 km) data as input. Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. The ocean color parameters are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] Other SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned Products: -SeaWiFS Level 3 PAR refers to false-colored images of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) from the sun 400-700 nm. For additional information about the PAR algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf -SeaWiFS Land Reflectance (LND) refers to the images that depict land areas of the world in quasi-natural-color More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Borehole Locations and Permafrost Depths, Alaska, USA. ABSTRACT: The methods utilized by the U.S. Geological Survey to measure subsurface temperatures have evolved considerably over the years. Although some of the early measurements were obtained using thermistor strings frozen into permafrost, the vast majority of the measurements were made in fluid-filled holes using a custom temperature sensor. A typical sensor used in Alaska prior to 1989 consisted of a series-parallel network of 20 thermistors; see Sass et al. [1971] for a more detailed description. During a logging experiment, the resistance of the thermistor network was determined using a Wheatstone bridge prior to 1967. After that time, a 4-wire resistance measurement was made using a commercial 5.5-digit multimeter (DMM). Before 1984, boreholes were logged in the 'incremental' or 'stop-and-go' modes; the vertical spacing of the measurements was typically 3-15 m. Beginning in 1984, the depth resistance measurements were automatically stored on magnetic tape, allowing boreholes to be logged in the 'continuous' mode; the typical data spacing for the continuous temperature logs was 0.3 m (1 ft). Many of the Alaskan boreholes were re-logged several times to quantify the thermal disturbance caused by drilling the holes (see Lachenbruch and Brewer [1959]). A review of current temperature measuring techniques used by the USGS in the polar regions is given by Clow et al. [1996]. Data from 1950-1989 are included on the CAPS CD-ROM Version 1.0, June 1998..

TITLE: ARCTIC80s_BIONESS. ABSTRACT: This collection includes data collected during two Hudson cruises, one between July 29 to August 3, 1980 and the second between August 7 to August 14, 1983 Plankton samples were collected using the BIONESS sampler equipped with 243u mesh nets. Profiles were from the bottom to the surface. The samples collected were preserved in 4% formaldehyde and later analysed down to species for Copepoda and genus for all other classes and phyla. A wet weight for each group was also measured. Associated chlorophyll, phaeophytin and nutrient data are available.The purpose of this study was to look at the vertical distribution of all major species of zooplankton in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, with particular emphasis on chaetognaths and copepods (Calanus species and their copepodites in particular) using fine-scale biological samples and simultaneous temperature and salinity data..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Monthly Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Modelling Carbon Sequestration in Forested Landscapes (CASFOR-II). ABSTRACT: The general objectives of the Modelling Carbon Sequestration in Forested Landscapes (CASFOR-II) project are to consist of A) the develop a general model for estimating carbon balance and carbon sequestration capacity in forested landscapes or regions, and B) the dissemination of this model amongst the user-community via the Internet. The proposed project builds onto an existing project "CASFOR: Carbon sequestration in afforestation and sustainable management: presentation of a general evaluation tool and generic case studies", which runs from 1999-2001. This project has been highly successful in providing a ecosystem level model to estimate carbon budgets and carbon sequestration for various forest types to a wide range of users world-wide. To date, over 500 users from more than 60 countries have downloaded the model CO2FIX from the project website. Measurement and verification of achievement of specific objectives will be done by monitoring of project progress in terms of milestones and deliverables, and through direct involvement of the user community in the application of the model CO2FIX. The specific scientific and technological objectives of the proposed project CASFOR-II consist of the expansion of the existing ecosystem-level model CO2FIX to a software tool that can be used to analyse carbon budgets at the project- or landscape-level. Expansion of the ecosystem-level model to the level of a landscape or project enables the consequences for carbon sequestration of land-use changes such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation (ARD). This expansion of the model CO2FIX is, amongst others, intended to provide users with a tool to analyse the consequences of different scenarios of ARD options as specified under the UN-FCCC Kyoto protocol. Aimed at decision support, the model will include basic economic assessments of costs of carbon sequestration, as well as effects of large-scale disturbances on long-term carbon sequestration. As part of the project, ARD options as identified in the IPCC Special Report on Land Use and Land Use Changes will be included in the decision support model., and to dissemination of the model and input parameters to an existing world-wide user-community using an interactive model-platform and information website. Output: 1. A general model for estimating carbon balance and carbon sequestration capacity in forested landscapes or regions; 2. Dissemination of the model via an Internet site.

TITLE: ChEssBase: an online information system on biodiversity and biogeography of deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. ABSTRACT: ChEssBase is a dynamic relational database available online since early 2005. The aim of ChEssBase is to provide taxonomic, biological, ecological and distributional data for all species described from deep-water chemosynthetic ecosystems, as well as information on available samples, images, bibliography and information on the habitats. These habitats include hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, whale falls, sunken wood and areas of minimum oxygen that intersect with the continental margin or seamounts. Since the discovery of hydrothermal vents in 1977 and of cold seep communities in 1984, over 590 species from vents and over 230 species from seeps have been described (Van Dover et al., 2002. Science 295: 1253-1257). Chemosynthetically fuelled communities have now also been found on large organic falls to the deep-sea floor such as whale falls and sunken wood, as well as on benthic zones of oxygen minimum. The data gathered in the last 30 years has shown that some species are shared amongst these ecosystems and our knowledge of their phylogeography improves with every new discovery. New species are continuously being discovered and described from research programmes around the globe and therefore ChEssBase is in active development and new data are being entered regularly. At present, ChEssBase includes data on 642 species from 421 genera from 76 chemosynthetic sites around the globe. These data contain information (when available) on the taxonomy, morphology, trophic level, reproduction, endemicity, habitat type and distribution. There are now 953 papers in our reference database. In summer 2005, ChEssBase and the InterRidge biological database ("http:  www.interridge.org") were fused into a single source of information for biological data from chemosynthetic ecosystems (Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2005 IR News, 14). This second version of ChEssBase is available online since August 2005, with new records as well as new search and download options. Taxonomically these data comprise all species living on deep-water chemosynthetic ecosystems: hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, whale falls and sunken wood.

TITLE: CTD Data collected by FIMR since 1977. ABSTRACT: The data set comprises the CTD observations made by the FIMR on R V Aranda cruises since 1977 and CTD observations made by Finnish Coast Guard on P S Merikarhu at a fixed staton in the Gulf of Finland since 1999. Nearly all the observations are from the Baltic Sea, mostly from the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and from the northern Baltic Proper. Outside the Baltic Sea data set contains CTD data from cruises to the Weddell Sea and to the Denmark Strait. The amount of CTD stations per year has varied between 500 and 1500. The measurement interval of the present CTD sondes is some centimetres, older sonde (used in years 1977-1985) had the interval of some tens centimetres. The small 'hang alone' SIS sonde have been used as an extra sonde on R V Aranda and on a few cruises made with other vessels. Every CTD down-cast has been stored as one file or two files which include besides the proper CTD data (depth series per station) also the date, time and the position information. The data from the year 1991 onwards have been averaged in one dbar interval. The data of SBE sondes have been processed with Sea-Bird's standard software. Measured parameters: temperature, conductivity and pressure, from 1998 also oxygen; Calculated parameters: salinity, density. CTD sondes: Plessey 9040 (1977-1985), Mk-III (1986- 1997), SBE 911 plus (1994-), SIS plus 500 (1988-), Seacat SBE19 (P S Merikarhu 1999- )..

TITLE: Canadian GPS Height Transformation Package (GPS-H). ABSTRACT: The GPS Height Transformation Package (GPS-H) allows Global Positioning System (GPS), Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and Wide Area Differential Global Positioning System (WADGPS) users in Canada to convert their NAD83(CSRS98) ellipsoidal heights to CGVD28 (Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928) orthometric heights (heights above mean sea level). The GPS-H package consists of both data and software. The height transformation package is based on two data models: * CGG2000: Scientific model of the geoid for North America generated solely from gravity data collected up to 2000. * HTv2.0 (CGG2000 + HRG01 + Transformation ITRF97-NAD83CSRS98): The CGG2000 geoid model adjusted to the Canadian primary vertical control (CGVD28) by means of 1285 NAD83(CSRS98) ellipsoidal heights throughout Canada. HTv2.0 makes possible the direct transformation of NAD83(CSRS98) ellipsoidal heights to CGVD28 orthometric heights.GPS-H allows Canadian GPS users to convert NAD83(CSRS98) ellipsoidal heights to CGVD28 orthometric heights with the use of the HTv2.0 geoid model.

TITLE: The Epipelagic Fish Community of Beaufort Sea Coastal Waters. ABSTRACT: Purpose: APPLICATION OF RESEARCH: The information is needed for environmental assessments relative to offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in Prudhoe Bay and the eastern Beaufort Sea (e.g., Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). Prior to this effort, these data were not readily accessible to resource managers or other researchers. Abstract: An arcticle was prepared to describe the results of offshore fishery research conducted in northern Alaska. The research was conducted between 1988 and 1991 but new information obtained on the distribution and abundance of Arctic fishes was never published. The combined, multi-year oceanographic (fishery and hydrography) sampling effort repesents the most extensive data set (including resource inventory) from offshore locations in the Beaufort Sea to-date. The main objective was to obtain a broad spatial-temporal sampling extending several kilometers offshore of the mainland coast, with the ultimate goal of discerning general patterns in community composition, species relative abundance, and habitat relationships. An emphasis was placed on dolly varden (Salvelinus malma) and arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis) habitat utilization of marine waters. Both are regionally important in subsistence and commercial fisheries. The offshore work employed active sampling gears and associated thermohaline profiles providing high spatial-temporal resolution of catch and environmental observations. This is in contrast to other published ecological studies of the North Slope that have relied on passive gears and less precise fish habitat associations. The ranges of variability in regional oceanography and their effects on the fish community, evident during this study, exemplify the ability of spatially extensive sampling to capture pattern over a wide spectrum of spatial-temporal scales.

TITLE: Northern Biosphere Observation and Modelling Experiment. ABSTRACT: The Northern Biosphere Observation and Modelling Experiment (NBIOME) is a scientific program designed to address key issues and uncertainties in the relationship between terrestrial ecosystems and global environmental change over the Canadian landmass. It will provide an improved understanding of the role of the terrestrial vegetation in the total Earth system. The objectives of NBIOME are 1) to develop and validate methods for the extraction of biophysical and biochemical parameters from optical and microwave satellite data for major Canadian biomes; 2) to develop methods for extending measurements or process understanding embedded in models across a range of spatial scales, from leaf to stand, landscape and region; and 3) to use satellite-derived parameters with data from other sources as input to models for the assessment of ecosystem performance at various time scales from day to season, year, decade and century. The project is a cooperative effort between scientists in universities and government agencies (the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Energy, Mines and Resources Canada (now Natural Resources Canada), Forestry Canada and Agriculture Canada). NBIOME datasets have been compiled and are gradually becoming available.The goal of NBIOME is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the climate and the northern ecosystems, including their seasonal, interannual and long-term dynamics and their role in the global carbon cycle.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Algal response to transplantation with a ice core flipping experiment, Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea. ABSTRACT: Three ice cores were drilled in sea ice (2.1 m thick) in the region of Gondwana Station in Terra Nova Bay during the 06-07 season. The cores were stored in black plastic bags and then replaced back within the same hole but in reverse order so that the algae from the bottom of the ice were now at the surface of the ice and the ice at the ice surface were now at the ice water interface at the bottom of the sea ice. An additional three profile cores were also drilled but were replaced back into their original holes in the normal configuration as a control. A further 3 cores were then extracted from the ice and processed for chlorophyll, cell numbers and species composition etc as above. At the end of the deployment period the six cores still in the ice were redrilled and extracted from the ice and samples also taken for chlorophyll, cell numbers and species composition as above. A further 3 cores of undisturbed ice were also taken..

(The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: J-CAD Drifting Buoy Data, Arctic Ocean, 2000-2002. ABSTRACT: This data set contains drifting buoy measurements taken from the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) Compact Arctic Drifters (J-CADs). The J-CAD buoys drift with the ice pack, collecting navigational, atmospheric, and oceanographic measurements, and transmitting the data via satellite. Since 2000, investigators have been conducting operations of the J-CADs to measure the structure of upper-ocean currents and water properties under the multi-year ice of the Arctic Ocean for a better understanding of the role the Arctic Ocean plays in global climate. This data set contains measurements from J-CAD buoys 1, 3, and 4, from years 2000-2002. For each buoy it takes approximately one year to drift throught the Arctic Ocean, pass through Fram Strait into the Greenland Sea, and reach the ice edge, where transmission ceases. This research was funded by the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, grant number OPP-9910305..

TITLE: Arctic & Antarctic Research Center (AARC) DMSP OLS Direct Readout Radiance Data from Palmer and McMurdo Stations, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: DMSP OLS level 0 raw telemetry data are acquired on selective passes by satellite receivers located at McMurdo Station, Antarctica (77 degrees, 51 minutes S, 166 degrees, 40 minutes E.) and Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula (64 degrees, 46 minutes S, 64 degrees, 4 minutes W.) Generally, most of the Antarctic continent and its coastline are covered daily. Swaths are 2250 kilometers long and generally start or end over the extreme South Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Ross Sea. Continuous data collection at McMurdo Station began on 9 February 1991, and at Palmer Station on 18 January 1990. The band width for LF LS (light fine smooth) is 00.4 - 01.1um and the TF TS (temperature fine smooth) is 10.8 - 12.5um. The data resolution is 550 meters at crosstrack. Data are archived, processed for requesters, and distributed by the Arctic & Antarctic Research Center (AARC). Processing of the raw data will depend on the requirements of the requester, but a typical sequence might be as follows: + Reformat raw data for extraction; up to 10 missing scan lines can be interpolated by the software. + Calibrate the reformatted data to convert from brightness values to temperature values. + Apply the moisture atmospheric correction. + Register selected data to the user-specified grid. + Transfer to user-specified medium. Some examples are tape, diskette, photographic product, or file format for electronic transfer. About 95 percent of the presently archived data is cataloged in our online directory. Data dropouts, caused by transmission interference due to solar flare activity, occur in some images; the processing software can smooth the data if fewer than 10 scan lines are missing. All archived images contain usable data. Processed data are binary byte arrays of user-defined size. Full spacecraft attitude correction and earth correction routines are applied to the raw data to create the products. Orbital elements, equator crossings, altitude and period of the spacecraft are generated for the raw data using the AARC scientific workstation. Data products can be gridded to a user-specified grid. Data are also available in raw form (10 bits of information stored in a 16 bit word) on DDS2 or DDS3 DAT cassettes or on DLT7000 tapes. Users would need access to an 4mm DAT or DLT7000 tape drive. An alternative method to access the digital archive is to use the Sun Workstations located at the AARC, Scripps Institution of Oceanography. AARC personnel can be contacted for access information..

TITLE: NSIDC Daily Precipitation Sums at Coastal and Island Russian Arctic Stations, 1940-1990. ABSTRACT: "This data set contains precipitation data originally recorded in log books at 65 coastal and island meteorological stations, and later digitized at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia, under the direction of Vladimir Radionov. Records from most stations begin in 1940. Instrumentation was generally a rain gauge with Nipher shield until the early 1950s (for most stations), when the Tretyakov precipitation gauge replaced earlier instrumentation. Data have not been adjusted for gauge type or wind bias. Data from 1967 and later are corrected for wetting loss (this correction was made by observers as they recorded the station data).", quoted summary from NSIDC documentation. The data files and associated documentation were downloaded from NSIDC to this DSS dataset in January 2007.

TITLE: BOREAS TGB-07 AMBIENT AIR HERBICIDE AND ORGANOCHLORINE CONCENTRATION DATA. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-07 team measured the concentration and flux of several agricultural pesticides in air, rainwater, and dry deposition samples in order to determine the associated yearly deposition rates. This data set contains information on the ambient air concentration of seven herbicides [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacidic_acid (2,4-D), bromoxynil, dicamb, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), triallate, trifluralin, and diclop-methyl] known to appear in the atmosphere of the Canadian prairies. Also, the concentration of three herbicides (atrazine, alaclor and metolachlor), two groups of insecticides (lindane and breakdown products and dichlro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and breakdown products), and several polychlorinated biphenyls commonly used in the central United States were measured. All of these chemicals are reported, in the literature, to be transported in the atmosphere. Many have been reported to occur in boreal and arctic food chains. The s ampling was carried out from June 16 to August 13, 1993 and May 4 to July 20, 1994 at the BOREAS site in the Prince Albert National Park (Waskesiu)..

TITLE: Hydrologic Outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet. ABSTRACT: The Hydrologic Outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet data set contains GIS point shapefiles that include 891 observed and potential hydrologic outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as identified by Lewis and Smith (2009), using satellite imagery. There are 460 observed hydrologic outlets that include proglacial streams and rivers emerging from the ice sheet (length scale >1 km), proglacial lakes touching the ice edge or clearly connected to it via streams or rivers (length scale >3 km), and sediment-rich plumes exiting tidewater glaciers into fjˆrds. Also, there are 431 potential hydrologic outlets that include point locations with release of meltwater from fjords without obvious sediment discharge, as well as locations where the ice sheet directly connects to the ocean that cannot be proven to release meltwater. Meltwater features along the entire edge of the ice sheet were mapped via photointerpretation of GoogleEarth and Landsat ETM+ 15 m panchromatic data. The exact acquisition dates of the imagery are not availabe; however, owing to the light and relatively snow-free conditions seen in the GoogleEarth and Landsat images, it is presumed that they were taken during the summer season. Neither Landsat or GoogleEarth images were available for a section of ice sheet within the northern Tunu region; therefore, that region was excluded from the study. This excluded area represents approximately 0.9 percent of the ice sheet perimeter. Data are available via FTP, and can be read in any GIS software. The following journal article provides documentation for this data set: Lewis, Sarah and Laurence Smith. 2009. Hydrologic Drainage of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

TITLE: Model Output from MBL-GEM III for Typical Tussock Tundra in the Kuparuk River Basin, Alaska, 1921-2100. ABSTRACT: This data set includes output data from the MBL-GEM III model for tussock tundra in the Kuparuk River watershed of Alaska. The model outputs 154 different variables for 123 10 km x 10 km grid cells, and assumes no interaction between adjacent grid cells. Diverse output variables include photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil moisture and respiration, among others. Yearly model results are available for the years 1921 through 2100, with climate drivers based on historical reconstruction of climate and carbon dioxide conditions (for 1921-2000) and two possible future climate scenarios (warmer and wetter climate versus warmer and drier climate, for 2001-2100). Each file included in this 246-file data set contains simulation results for one of the 123 cells for the entire time period, based on one of the two predicted climate scenarios..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Yearly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: Electronic Nautical Chart Index. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been in the forefront worldwide in the development and dissemination of electronic navigational charts (ENCs). Hydrographic survey data is stored and displayed electronically in either raster (a direct electronic reproduction of a paper chart) or vector (the user can manipulate the display scale, types of data, and level of detail) formats. CHS makes electronic charts (ECs) available to companies manufacturing ECDIS or EC systems for a variety of large and small vessel owners.When combined with the GPS, radar, ship course, speed, and draft in an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), the electronic navigational chart (ENC) becomes part of a powerful system allowing mariners to know their ship's position instantly and accurately and to be warned of dangerous situations..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Climatology Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) CWT001: Coweeta Climatic Measurements. ABSTRACT: LTER CWT001: This data set contains Level 1 climatic parameters for the main Coweeta Climatic Station. All the data have been collected daily and are summarized by the following parameters: monthly mean temperature, monthly maximum and minimum temperature, monthly total precipitation, and monthly mean global radiation. During the last 50 years, 30 climatic stations were operated at Coweeta. Only the main station has been continuously active since 1934. Over 135 precipitation sites have been gaged at various times over the past 50 years. Precipitation modified by topography is a dominant factor in Coweeta climate. Precipitation consists of frequent, small, low-intensity rains in all seasons with little snow. The Coweeta basin experiences frequent afternoon clouds in the summer thereby affecting the amount of solar radiation. Only 10 to 15% of the summer solar radiation is transmitted through the fully leafed canopy and about 50% during dormant months. Information about LTER is also available at "http:  lternet.edu " NOTE: LTER data may be made available to individuals for research purposes. Use of LTER data requires that NSF's LTER grant and the Principal Investigator of the dataset be sent a copy of the report or manuscript prior to submission and be adequately cited in any resultant publications. Datasets are provided by the Coweeta LTER Data Bank, a partnership between the Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia, and the U.S. Forest Service Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Otto, North Carolina..

TITLE: Hexacorallians of the World (IOBIS). ABSTRACT: A compilation of publications concerning taxonomy, nomenclature, and geographic distribution of extant hexacorallians - members of cnidarian orders Actiniaria (sea anemones in the strict sense), Antipatharia (black corals), Ceriantharia (tube anemones), Corallimorpharia (sea anemones in the loose sense), Ptychodactiaria (sea anemones in the loose sense), Scleractinia (hard or stony corals), and Zoanthidea (sea anemones in the loose sense) Funded largely by US National Science Foundation grants DEB95-21819 and DEB99-78106 (in the program PEET - Partnerships to Enhance Expertise in Taxonomy) and supplements in the REU program (Research Experience for Undergraduates) to Daphne G. Fautin, and grant OCE00-03970 (in NOPP, the National Oceanographic Partnership Program) to D.G.F. and Robert W. Buddemeier. Sea Anemones of the World Data include: * Bibliographic reference to the work in which each taxon was originally described * Synonymy of each taxon * Taxonomic status of each taxon * Images of many species - from the published literature as well as previously unpublished ones * Type specimens - by species and by museum * Type locality of each species * Published distribution of each species * List of relevant publications by each author * Classification schemes of Hexacorallia Updates, including both additions and corrections, are being made continually in all categories. Corrections are made as errors are found. Additions of data and functionalities are made at intervals of several months; the date of the current version is prominently displayed. Archival copies of previous versions can be obtained upon request. As of 31 January 2003, the inventory of genera and species was virtually complete for Actiniaria, Antipatharia Ceriantharia, Corallimorpharia, and Ptychodactiaria (now considered a component of Actiniaria), although not all associated data are available for every species. As bibliographic details for higher taxonomic levels are assembled, the hierarchical placement of each taxon will be specified. Data on type specimens are from two sources. A small number of records are from listings in published type catalogs of two museums, and from original descriptions that specified as repositories museums that have not been visited. Most records are from examination of the specimens by Daphne Fautin in 40 natural history museums in Europe, the Pacific, and North America. The museums that have been visited include those with large holdings of sea anemone type specimens.

TITLE: Investigating respiratory viruses from Antarctic personnel at Scott Base, McMurdo Station and South Pole Station to determine immune system adaptation to climatic extremes. ABSTRACT: Aspects of human biomedical and immunological adaptation to Antarctic isolation was studied including the occurrence of respiratory virus infections in people overwintering in Antarctica and the reasons for their rapid loss of resistance to infection under these conditions. Winter over personnel are initially exposed to colds and other infections brought to Antarctica by summer support and scientific personnel at Scott Base and McMurdo Station. At this time, their immunity to these infections is maintained at normal levels. However, at the onset of winter isolation, the frequency of upper respiratory infections decreases and a consequent decline in immunity, often to sub normal levels occurs. Return to civilisation is often accompanied with an increased frequency of upper respiratory illness. In order to understand the immune mechanism involved, we need to know; a) the virus or viruses causing upper respiratory infections during the summer season and or during winter isolation and b) the antibody levels to a particular virus or viruses in winter over personnel throughout the year. Blood, throat and nasal swabs and nasal wash samples were collected from Scott Base staff at four different periods; i) Pre Antarctic collection (October 1975 Christchurch), ii) Mid summer collection (December 1975 Scott Base), iii) Mid winter collections (August, 1976 McMurdo) and iv) Win Fly collection (September 1976 Scott Base). In addition, specimens were taken from acute upper respiratory cases occurring in both winter over or summer support personnel during the summer season, when possible. Cell culture facilities were established at the Eklund Biological Centre to provide the best possible conditions for virus isolation at McMurdo and Scott Base. Samples were inoculated directly into cell culture for the isolation of viruses. The facility was also transferred to the biomedical laboratory at the South Pole Station to monitor the spread of virus infections to this base. A total of 11 viral isolated were made from specimens collected and directly inoculated into cell culture either at McMurdo, Scott Base or South Pole Station..

TITLE: Arctic Ocean and Climate Atlas (1950-1989). ABSTRACT: This CD-ROM atlas contains statistics of 45 years of summer (July through September) temperature and salinity data. All temperatures in this atlas are shown as potential temperatures. Salinities are reported in standard salinity units. Densities are reported as potential density. Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile of the temperature and salinity data were calculated for each decade in the data set and over each 200 km by 200 km grid cell within the central Arctic region. In the Nordic and Siberian Seas, the statistics were calculated over 50 km by 50 km cells, as well as 100 km by 100 km cells, due to the smaller spatial scales in this region. These statistics were compiled for depths (in meters below the ocean surface) of 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, and 4000. The ocean bottom bathymetry was defined using the National Geophysical Data Center ETOPO5 digital data set. The decadal periods are: 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989. The number of original data points used to calculate the statistics are recorded for each location and a planar fit to the data, at each depth, was also generated to indicate linear trends within each cell. The three coefficients of the planar fit and the root-mean-square error of the fit are also recorded in the atlas. It was agreed to publish these statistics because most of the Russian original data could not be released. The CD-ROM atlas also contains a complete set of statistics for the periods, June, October and November. Statistics for December through May are available in the atlas for the winter period..

TITLE: GISP2 10Be Concentration, 40,000 Years, Finkel and Nishiizumi 1997. ABSTRACT: Melted water was collected from the outside of samples taken for cation and anion analysis. A small aliquot was taken for anion analysis (chloride, nitrate, and sulfate) and the remainder was weakly acidified with HNO3 to yield a final pH of about 2. Be, Cl and Al carriers were then added. The Be (and Al and Cl) were concentrated from the melted ice using ion exchange resins. Be was then eluted from the cation exchange column, precipitated as Be(OH)2 and ignited to BeO for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement. The AMS measurements were carried out at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (Davis et al., 1990). The 10Be (half-life = 1.5 x 10^6 years) concentration was normalized to an ICN standard (diluted by K. Nishiizumi) after carrier blank and boron background correction..

TITLE: A cross-calibrated, multi-platform, multi-instrument ocean surface wind velocity data set (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov PRODUCTS p079.html). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used (http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR (http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. Each data stream contains three standard products designated as level 3.0, 3.5 and 2.5. Level 3.0 data contains 6-hourly gridded VAM instantaneous analyses. These analyses are time averaged over 5-day and monthly periods to derive the Level 3.5 products. Only those grid points with one or more analyzed observations are used in the average. Finally, directions from the VAM analyses are assigned to the wind speed observations daily for each microwave sensor (DMSP SSM I, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI) to derive the Level 2.5 products. Level 3.0 and 3.5 data sets are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF, http:  hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu). Level 2.5 products are stored in binary "bytemap" files to parallel the original satellite data files from RSS. All observations are mapped to a 25 km grid and packed into 1-byte integers. Data also distributed in NetCDF format (http:  www.unidata.ucar.edu software netcdf ). All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s. Each data set is archived using the following naming convention: NAME_YYYYMMDD_vVVlLLPPP.TTT.gz where NAME - unique identifier describing the data YYYYMMDD - date time expressed as year, month, day VV - product version number (in tenths) LL - product level designation (in tenths) PPP - product stream (flk or llk) TTT - file type designating the data format For example, "analysis_20040101_v10l30flk.nc.gz" designates a level 3.0 (l30) data set containing VAM analyses for January 1, 2004 from version 1.0 (v10) of the first-look (flk) product stream in NetCDF (.nc) format. The ".gz" node indicates that the file must first be de-compressed using the GNU zip (gzip) compression utility..

TITLE: GRAVSAT: Regional Gravity Anomaly Surveys from Satellite Altimetry. ABSTRACT: GRAVSAT provides gravity survey information for the offshore oil and gas exploration industry. Based on the analysis of radar altimetry from the ERS-1 Geodetic Phase, completed in March 1995, high resolution gravity information is derived from the along track sea surface slopes measured by the satellite. At the equator, tracks are approximately 8km apart, reducing to 4km at 60 degrees of latitude, thus providing similar sampling to many conventional ship surveys. GRAVSAT gravity anomaly data have been validated against ship measurements over several areas of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, for which the British Geological Survey have comprehensive datasets..

TITLE: BOREAS TGB-07 RAINWATER HERBICIDE AND ORGANOCHLORINE CONCENTRATION DATA. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-07 team measured the concentration and flux of several agricultural pesticides in air and rainwater samples in order to determine the associated yearly deposition rates. This data set contains information on the rainwater concentration of seven herbicides [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacidic_acid (2,4-D), bromoxynil, dicamb, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), triallate, trifluralin, and diclop-methyl] known to appear in the atmosphere of the Canadian prairies. Also, the concentration of three herbicides (atrazine, alaclor and metolachlor), two groups of insecticides (lindane and breakdown products and dichlro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and breakdown products), and several polychlorinated biphenyls commonly used in the central United States were measured. All of these chemicals are reported, in the literature, to be transported in the atmosphere. Many have been reported to occur in boreal and arctic food chains. The sampling was carried out from June 16 to August 13, 1993 and May 4 to July 20, 1994 at the BOREAS site in the Prince Albert National Park (Waskesiu)..

TITLE: Rand Corporation Mean Monthly Global Snow Depth. ABSTRACT: All available monthly snow depth climatologies were integrated by the Rand Corporation, in the early 1980s, into one global (excluding Africa and South America) digital data set gridded at 4 degrees latitude by 5 degrees Longitude. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers monthly climatologies were a primary data source. For data-sparse areas such as China, Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctica, special Rand methodologies were used: empirical evaluation of total precipitation, weather source regions, latitude, temperature, terrain and annual snow depth data. Monthly ice-pack limits from U.S. Navy Oceanographic Office were used to extend the zero snow accumulation line over the oceans. These mean monthly data can be used strictly as a climatological summary or for systematic comparison with simulations from any general circulation model (GCM), or for initiating GCM calculations. Data report copies are also available. The global grid is too coarse to pick up snow accumulation in Africa and South America, but no more than two grid points are involved in these areas..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Yearly Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Polar system boundary based on arctic and sub-arctic vegetation cover (1993-2005). ABSTRACT: The Polar System boundary for the MA has been delineated through the occurrence of arctic vegetation as defined by McGuire's vegetation coverage. This coverage has been modified slightly to be used within the MA. The ESRI DCW international boundary dataset was used to provide a more detailed coastline, and land pixels classified as ocean, have been replaced by the majority surrounding cells. Classes extracted from McGuire map include ice, barrens, and tundras (frostrate, graminoid, and forest). Lakes and non-arctic vegetation were excluded. Antarctica, as delineated in the ESRI DCW dataset, is included as a final category. McGuire's vegetation map was created in order to better delineate arctic and subarctic vegetation types important in the study of vegetation feedbacks to climate in high latitude ecosystems at the finest scale available. Because most of the global maps have highly aggregated vegetation types, they used continental or regional scale maps when possible and used a few of the global maps for ice and lake cover. The Alaska region is based on Fleming (1997), which had one "tundra" category for all of interior and southern Alaska. The "tundra" category was replaced in all parts of the state with the exception of the North Slope and the Seward Peninsula with background vegetation from the USGS 1 km spatial resolution Land Cover dataset, which was crosswalked to the tundra types in our study. The North Slope (Muller et al. 1999) and Seward Peninsula (Thayer-Snyder, 2000) coverages were generated from Landsat MSS data. Eurasian vegetation was based on Belov (1990). 1 km IGBP data was used to differentiate the "woodland tundra" category in this region. Western Eurasian vegetation was based on Melillo et al (1993) with enhanced temperate deciduous vegetation. Canadian vegetation was based on the 1 km Land Cover vegetation dataset from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, which was prepared from multi-temporal AVHRR data (Cilhar and Beaubien, 1998). Lakes were taken from the IGBP dataset, the Melillo et al. classification, and the 1 km Canadian vegetation dataset. The ice category was also from the Melillo et al vegetation map and was not altered. Purpose: Delineates the spatial extent of the polar system boundary for use within the MA..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Daily Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: Late Quaternary Climatic & Vegetation History of the Alaskan North Slope: Calibration of Modern Data. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: "Late Quaternary Climatic & Vegetation History of the Alaskan North Slope: Calibration of Modern Data" is a dataset that describes the vegetational history of northwestern Alaska; reconstructs past climate during this period based on palynological and other geological data, and compares these paleoclimatic interpretations to a regional model of long-term variations of large-scale controls of climate (e.g. insolation, ice volume, atmospheric composition). The purpose of these data is to examine the vegetation and climate history of far northern Alaska over the last 18,000 years as a means of improving knowledge about terrestrial-climate systems inter-actions in low arctic settings, thereby better enabling determination of possible responses of arctic ecosystems to proposed global warming. Collection Organization: University of Washington Collection Methodology: Analyze lake sediments from a suite of sites located in four different tundra settings of the Alaskan North Slope. Calibrate pollen, moss spores, and lignins deposited in modern sediments with surrounding vegetation and climatic parameters to assess their ability to accurately reconstruct past environments. Apply those calibrations to a set of fossil records chosen during the modern sampling.

TITLE: Biodiversity of Antarctic Fungi. ABSTRACT: Continental Antarctica is considered an extreme terrestrial environment, which can be colonized only by microorganisms with high level of adaptation. Microbiological investigations in the southern cold temperate to Polar Regions have been concentrated largely on the sub-Antarctic islands, the Antarctic Peninsula and the McMurdo Dry Valleys region of Southern Victoria Land. The studies suggest a low diversity of indigenous fungi in continental Antarctica with around 150 taxa recognized in the literature. The purpose of this research is to study the diversity of Antarctic fungi. This data represent diversity of Antarctic fungi isolated from samples of soil from Windmill Islands, Antarctica such as Thalla Valley, SSSI17, Wilkes Station, Whitney Point, Casey Station and Peterson Island. All material was collected at various locations in December 2001, February 2002 and 2004. A total of 10 fungi species were isolated which 5 represent Hyphomycetes, two Ascomycetes, one Coelomycete, one Zygomycete and one yeast. The main species isolated were Cadophora malorum, Geomyces cretaceous and Thelebolus sp. A variety of fungi and yeast were encountered in soil samples in different localities: Aureobasidium sp., Antarctomyces sp., Mucor sp., Mrakia frigida, Trichosporiella cerebriformis, and Phoma sp. Ten fungal taxa were identified. Nine different genera were recorded. The majority were Hyphomycetes, but Ascomycetes, Coelomycetes and Zygomycetes were also isolated. Hyphomycetes appear to dominate the fungal flora of Windmill Islands. Higher numbers and types of fungi were isolated from soil around Thala Valley, where 8 taxa were detected. The most commonly encountered taxa including Aureobasidium sp., Cadophora malorum and Geomyces cretaceus. Isolates obtained here included of taxa not isolated from other sites. Trichosporiella cerebriformis, Mucor sp. and unidentified sp. 9 were isolated only from Thala Valley. The isolation of Trichosporiella cerebriformis from Thala Valley represents a first record from continental Antarctica. Other taxa recovered included Antarctomyces sp. and Mrakia frigida. Microfungi isolated mainly from mineral soils from Whitney Point included Aureobasidium sp., Cadophora malorum, Geomyces cretaceus, Antarctomyces sp., Thelebolus sp. and Mrakia frigida. Isolated fungal taxa appear non-uniformly distributed throughout the sampling region. Only Cadophora malorum and Mrakia frigida were isolated from SSSI-17. Geomyces cretaceus, Antarctomyces sp. and Thelebolus sp. were found in samples from Peterson Island. Three taxa were found at contaminated sites at Casey Station and four taxa were detected from soils from Wilkes Station. Basidiomycetous-type yeast, Mrakia frigida occurred in four localities; it was isolated from soil taken at Thala Valley, SSSI17, Whitney Point and contaminated sites at Wilkes Station. Geomyces cretaceus was isolated frequently and from a wide range of habitats, including the harsh environment of mineral soils near Casey Station and Wilkes Station..

TITLE: Gas Chromatography Data for Crude Oils, Condensates and Rock Extracts From Canadian and Selected International Sedimentary Basins. ABSTRACT: This data set includes gas chromatograms obtained from GC-FID analyses of mainly gasoline range (i-pentane to n-octane range) and saturated hydrocarbons fractions (>n-decane) of crude oils, condensates and rock organic extracts. Compound distribution patterns and a variety of compound ratios (based on compound relative or normalized abundance) are commonly used in organic geochemistry and petroleum studies to characterize crude oils, bitumens or dispersed sedimentary organic matter, and in oil-oil and oil-source correlation studies. These data have been utilized in petroleum system analysis applied to exploration, petroleum engineering optimization and environmental impacts mitigation in most Canadian and some international sedimentary basins. The data have been collected using various gas chromatograph (GC) flame ionization detector (FID) equipment, quantified using PE Nelson client server software with quantification results verified by a technologist. These data are used in the determination of: geochemical composition of crude oils and rock extracts, oil-oil correlation, oil-source correlation, oil alteration, biodegradation, thermal maturation, petroleum system analysis, petroleum source potential, petroleum exploration, energy assessment, environmental geology, petroleum production engineering.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Cumulative Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: POLDER Parasol Level-2 Radiation Budget collocated subset along CloudSat track. ABSTRACT: This is the POLDER Parasol Level-2 Radiation Budget Subset, collocated with the CloudSat track. The subset is processed at the A-Train Data Depot of the GES DISC, NASA. The algorithm first converts the original POLDER binary data, which is Level-2 but nevertheless in a sinusoidal grid, into HDF4 format, and thus stores the full-sized data in HDF4. Then, it calculates the CloudSat ground track coordinates, and proceeds to extract the closest POLDER grid cells. Along with the extraction, the algorithm re-orders the subset grid cells in a line-by-line fashion, so that the output subset is in array format and resembles a swath. This array has a cross-track dimension of 11 columns. That makes about 200-km-wide coverage. All original parameters are preserved in the subset. As it is collocated with CloudSat, the subset is automatically collocated with CALIPSO as well..

TITLE: Resource Allocation and Allometry of Plant Growth at Selected Sites in the Arctic: 2003-2005 Growing Seasons. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of seven data files containing measurements from Arctic field sites during the summer months from 5 July 2003 to 5 August 2005 as part of the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII) International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). Investigators designed this research, which compares an extensive range of vegetation types that exists in widely-separated sites, to help identify the relative vulnerability of different vegetation types, plant functional types, and species to climate change and other forms of disturbances. They evaluated specific parameters to improve understanding of the broad patterns of vegetation change and vegetation function across the Arctic and quantify the constraints on the patterns of growth of arctic-plant feedbacks to the Arctic System. The research sites are located in Alaska, USA; Abisko, Sweden; and Svalbard, Norway. Data are in Microsoft Excel (.xls) format, viewable with spreadsheet software. Data are distributed as an approximately 575 KB compressed file and are available via FTP..

TITLE: MSU Daily Oceanic Precipitation with Limb93 Correction V001 (MSUOP) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: Section 1. General Description Spencer and Christy (1990) demonstrated that accurate estimates of global atmospheric temperatures could be derived from the Microwave Sounding Units flown on NOAA's TIROS-N series of satellites. The MSU's have been continuously operating for more than 14 years collecting measurements of the thermal emission of radiation by molecular oxygen at four frequencies near 60 GHz. The four MSU channels have contribution functions (CF's) determined by their wavelength and the atmospheric profile of oxygen. MSU channel 1 has a CF peak near the surface, and is influenced strongly by temperature and liquid water near the surface. The channel 2 CF is dominated by a wide peak near 50 kPa. Channel 3 peaks near the tropopause (25 kPa) and the Channel 4 CF has a somewhat sharper peak in the lower stratosphere (7 kPa). Spencer and Christy (1992 a,b) demonstrated that the MSU calibrations have been very stable, with a precision of monthly satellite measurements of 0.01 deg C for the global mean. A. Oceanic Precipitation Data set. The oceanic precipitation estimates follow the method of Spencer (1993). Oceanic precipitation is estimated by increased warming in MSU channel 1 over a threshold. The increased warming is attributable to emission by liquid water in the lower troposphere. Warming due to air mass differences are removed using information from the MSU channel 2 3 retrieval. The precipitation estimate has been calibrated into mm per day rainfall using eight years of rain gauge data from tropical island locations. A climatological ice mask has been used to screen out anomalous precipitation over ice covered ocean. Likewise, the maximum value allowed has been set at 99.9 mm day to further screen out any remaining ice influence. Also, because this method only works in the Tropics and mid-latitudes, the retrieval is only calculated for latitudes 60 S to 60 N. Spencer (1993) discusses the calibration and demonstrates there is good agreement between the MSU precipitation estimates and previous climate rainfall data sets. Because the algorithm methodology uses all orbits in a 24 hour period to calculate the rainfall estimate, no diurnal information is available in this data set. B. MSU Calibration. The Limb93 precipitation retrievals use calibrated MSU data. The MSU brightness temperatures for all four channels were linearly calibrated using the radiometric counts measured viewing the earth scene as compared to the difference between the radiometric measurement while viewing a warm calibration load and a similar view of deep space (assumed to be 2.5K). For information on the calibration procedure, the user is referred to the TOVS MSU Pathfinder User's Guide. Section 2. MSU LIM93 Oceanic Precipitation Data File Structure The MSU Limb93 data files are given in HDF structure. Every file contains 365 Scientific Data Sets (366 for leap years), one for each day of the year. Each SDS contains a two dimensional data set, the x dimension is longitude and the y dimension is latitude. The grid is composed of 144 (longitude) by 72 (latitude) 2.5 by 2.5 degree grid boxes. The first grid box is centered at 88.75 N 178.75 W. The data structure for the SDS data is int16, and the data are given in tenth of mm day of rainfall. Land areas, areas at high latitudes (above 60 degrees), and grid boxes with missing data have a value of -999..

TITLE: DMSP-F8 SSM I Pathfinder Global Level 2 Sea Ice Concentrations. ABSTRACT: These sea ice concentrations have been generated by applying the NASA Team algorithm to DMSP F8 SSM I brightness temperature observations from 19 GHz (vertical and horizontal), 37- and 22 GHz vertical frequencies, calculating two gradients for use as weather filters. Global coverage is provided, but sea ice concentrations are only derived for ocean, ice, and possible ice surfaces poleward of 35 degrees latitude, from 1 August 1987 through 30 November 1988. In the Northern Hemisphere, where data are not filtered due to weather effects, first-year and multi-year concentrations (in percent) are calculated; total ice concentration is taken as the sum of these two. Only total ice is calculated for the Southern Hemisphere. 25 km swath data are in HDF, available via FTP..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Climatology Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Detailed analysis of 35 most common species found in Long Island Sound benthic communities, USGS OFR 00-304. ABSTRACT: This GIS layer, which focuses on benthic communities, was developed as part of a cooperative project between the University of New Haven, the Connecticut DEP, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Benthic communities are an integral component of the ecology of Long Island Sound. Understanding the role that spatial heterogeneity plays in the dynamic of benthic landscapes may be a key to developing a better understanding of the estuarine ecology and the impacts of human activity. The purpose of providing this data layer is to help establish a regional framework for developing a more extensive GIS for benthic communities in Long Island Sound that can be used for education, research, and environmental management. This GIS layer provides the location where samples from Pellegrino and Hubbard were summarized to provide detailed analysis of 35 common species found in Long Island Sound benthic communities..

TITLE: Data of biodiversity of marine bacterioplankton at Kongsfjorden in the summer of 2008. ABSTRACT: Phylogenetic diversity of the marine bacterioplankton in Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen) was investigated through 16S rRNA gene analysis. Community fingerprint analysis by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that there was no apparent difference of bacterioplankton community composition between sampling locations in the fjord. A higher biodiversity was observed in bottom water of Stn. 3 in the central part of the fjord. By 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, sequences detected both in surface and bottom water of Station 3 fell into eight putative divisions, including Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and unidentified bacteria, in addition to chloroplasts of algae. Sequences representing Planctomycetes were only observed in bottom water. Compared to the preponderance of clones representing Gammaproteobacteria (36.5%) and Alphaproteobacteria (29.4%) in bottom water, Alphaproteobacteria (43.6%) and algae (27.7%) constituted two dominant fractions in surface water. Cloned sequences showed 82.1 to 100% similarity to those described sequences..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products.

TITLE: Atlas of Coastal Habitats and Fishery Resources - Northern Quebec. ABSTRACT: This collection covers Hudson Bay, James Bay and Ungava Bay. These areas form the basis of three separate products. The three bays lie along the Quebec border north of the 50th parallel, in subarctic and arctic territory. The information included in these three products covers six themes, four of them biotic in nature (vegetation, invertebrates, fish, marine mammals) and two abiotic (habitat and zoning and uses). Each of these themes is divided into sub-themes (e.g. red algae, rainbow smelt), which are further subdivided into information classes (distribution, concentration, reproduction, oceanographic characteristics, etc.).The Habitat Management Division (HMD) of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has developed a management tool to take advantage of knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of fishery resources and of the characterization of their habitats to achieve integrated management of Quebec's coastal environment. To that end, HMD has developed a geographic information system (GIS), also called FHAMIS, which is intended to manage, analyse and map data on fish habitat for purposes of: 1) habitat impact evaluation under the Fisheries Act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the Fish Habitat Policy; 2) restoration and enhancement of fish habitat; 3) implementation of initiatives under the new Oceans Act (marine protected areas, integrated coastal area management); 4) environmental emergency response (advice on the protection of habitat and resources); 5) provision of information on habitat to DFO clients (managers, scientists, NGOs, coastal communities, departments, consultants).

TITLE: IABP-POLES 2-Meter Air Temperature Data Set. ABSTRACT: The POLES Arctic Gridded 2-meter Air Temperature Data Set provides optimally interpolated 2-meter air temperatures on the EASE (Equal Area SSM I Earth) grid at intervals of 4 times daily for the years 1979 through 1992. Munoz and Martin (1995) give a full description of the optimal interpolation scheme. The EASE grid used for this data set is a subset of the rectangular grid currently being used as a standard by the POLES group and is described in Schweiger and Francis (1995). Each of the grid points is separated by 200.54 km. The geographic domain of the data set is that region defined by the coastlines surrounding the seasonal and perennial ice covered oceans and seas of the northern hemisphere. The source of the temperature observations used in the scheme consist of data from land stations, ship observations from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), Soviet North Pole (NP) drifting ice stations, and Arctic drifting buoys. The temperature observations were taken at 2-meter heights at the land, Soviet NP and marine stations, and at heights varying from tens of centimeters to about 3 meters above the surface for the buoys. Because the ice on which the buoys rest is thick, we make the assumption that the buoy temperatures are also 2-meter air temperatures..

TITLE: IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Observed Climate Change Impacts Database. ABSTRACT: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessement Report (AR4) Observed Climate Change Impacts Database contains observed responses to climate change across a wide range of systems as well as regions. These data were taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008). It consists of responses in the the physical, terrestrial biological systems and marine-ecosystems. The observations that were selected include data that demonstrate a statistically significant trend in change in either direction in systems related to temperature or other climate change variable, and the is for at least 20 years between 1970 and 2004, although study periods may extend earlier or later. For each observation, the data series is described in terms of system, region, longitude and latitude, dates and duration, statistical significance, type of impact, and whether or not land use was identified as a driving factor. System changes are taken from ~80 studies (of which ~75 are new since the IPCC Third Assessment Report) containing more than 29,500 data series. Observations in the database are characterized as a ‘change consistent with warming’ or a ‘change not consistent with warming,’ based on information from the underlying studies. The data is distributed by the Columbia University Center for Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)..

TITLE: GEOSAT ERS-1 Marine Gravity Anomaly Data and Maps produced by Scripps and NOAA. ABSTRACT: Upon the release of the previously classified data from the U.S. Navy GEOSAT satellite in July 1995, researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and NOAA's National Ocean Service Office of Ocean and Earth Science have created a detailed map of marine gravity anomalies from the satellite altimeter data. The satellite measured the distance from the satellite to sea surface from March 1985 to October 1986. The distance data have been processed to depict small changes in the force of gravity throughout the oceans. These changes in gravity are the result of geologic features on the ocean floor. Because the previously classified Navy data are highly accurate (the altimeter measured distances of 500 miles accurate to 1 inch), and because of the GEOSAT mission's dense coverage, the gravity anomalies provide a view of the seafloor with unprecedented detail. To make the map, the GEOSAT data was combined with data from the European Space Agency's ERS-1 Satellite. The data are useful in studies of navigation, ocean bathymetry, undersea volcanoes, plate tectontics, petroleum geology, and lithosphere structure. The raw GEOSAT data are available on 4 CD-ROMs from the National Oceanographic Data Center: "http:  www.nodc.noaa.gov" The processed marine gravity anomaly data are available from Scripps in 2-minute or 3-minute grids: "ftp:  baltica.ucsd.edu pub" The marine gravity anomaly maps and more information can be found on the World Wide Web at the National Geophysical Data Center: "http:  www.ngdc.noaa.gov mgg announcements announce_predict.html" Hardcopy posters are available for $40 (check payable to Regents of the University fo California) from Scripps: University of California at San Diego Geological Data Center-0223 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla CA 90293-0223 [The information provided here was condensed from the NGDC WWW pages.].

TITLE: Dissolved Iron (DFe) Concentrations and Total Iron Concentrations of Profile and Surface Stations in the Southern Ocean. ABSTRACT: Dissolved iron (DFe) concentrations of 40 profile stations and 7 surface stations were measured directly on board by an automated Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) after a modified method of De Jong et al. 1998. In addition, unfiltered samples from 17 profiles and 7 surface stations were acidified and stored to determine the total Fe concentrations in the NIOZ laboratory after 6-12 months of dissolution (see table 1). Filtered (0.2µm) and acidified (pH 1.8) seawater was concentrated on a column containing aminodiacetid acid (IDA). This material binds only transition metals and not the interfering salts. After washing the column with ultra pure water, the column is eluted with diluted acid. After mixing with luminol, peroxide and ammonium, the oxidation of luminol with peroxide is catalyzed by iron and a blue light is produced and detected with a photon counter. The amount of iron is calculated using a standard calibration line, where a known amount of iron is added to low iron containing seawater. Using this calibration line a number of counts per nM iron is obtained. Samples were analyzed in duplicate sample bottles, each of which was measured in triplicate, and average DFe concentrations and standard deviation are given. Concentrations of DFe measured on the NBP0901 cruise ranged from 30 pM up to 0.7 nM. The standard deviation varied between 0% and 10% (the latter being exceptional), but was generally < 5% in samples with DFe concentrations higher than 0.1nM. Since samples containing less than 0.1nM DFe are near the detection limit of the system; the standard deviation of these measurements was sometimes high (<30%). The average blank was determined at 0.024nM±0.010nM and was defined as a sample loaded for 10 seconds and measured daily. The average limit of detection, 0.009±0.008 was defined as 3*standard deviation of the mean blank and measured daily. To better understand the day to day variation duplicate sample bottles were measured at least 24h later. The differences between these measurements were rather large, in the order of 5-20%, while the largest differences were measured in samples with low DFe concentrations. To correct for this day to day variation a so-called lab standard sample was measured daily. All data will be corrected for the mean average of this value after the cruise and all data presented so far are uncorrected for this day to day variation. The consistency of the FIA system over the course of the day was verified using a drift standard. The drift was observed to be less than 7% and no corrections have been made for this drift. A certified SAFe standard (Johnson et al. 2007) for the long term consistency and absolute accuracy was measured at a regular basis. Preliminary results The profile from station 16 clearly shows high iron input near the PIG (Fig. 5). DFe concentrations are high throughout the entire water column and indicate a constant input of DFe into the polynya. Profile 107, which is in the central Pine Island Polynya, shows much lower values throughout the first 300 meter which can be explained by the high phytoplankton abundance in the surface water. DFe concentrations during a transect from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) (101 S,30W) through the central Pine Island Polynya in north westwards direction clearly show the high DFe concentrations near the PIG and the rapid decrease of the DFe in the polynya, especially in waters shallower than 50m (Fig. 6). Extreme low DFe values in the central polynya correlate with the biological productive area as observed from the fluorometer data and Chl a measurements..

TITLE: Nimbus-7 SMMR Polar Gridded Radiances and Sea Ice Concentrations. ABSTRACT: NSIDC produces gridded brightness temperatures (TBs) on polar stereographic grids for north and south polar regions from orbital (swath) data collected by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) flown aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite. This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures (TB) and sea ice concentrations, spanning October 1978 through August 1987, when the SMMR scanner was turned off. Brightness temperature and sea ice concentration grids have 25 x 25 km grid elements. The data were collected every other day at 6.60, 10.69, 18.00, 21.00 and 37.00 GHz. (The scanner operated only on alternate days, due to spacecraft power limitations). There are usually at least 14 days of coverage per month, although major data gaps occur in 1982, August 4th, 8th, and 16th are missing for both polar regions; in 1984, August 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions. Volume 7 contains all SMMR sea ice concentrations for both polar regions, plus five months of TB grids for the north polar region. The NASA Team Algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984, Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986) was used to calculate ice concentrations from the TBs. Data were produced by Dr. P. Gloersen, NASA GSFC, Oceans and Ice Branch. Users note: SMMR TCT tapes comprised the input data set, unlike the one-volume SMMR CD-ROM product distributed by NSIDC in 1979. An online guide available for this data set. CD-ROM distribution currently at no charge, first priority to NASA and NASA-funded investigators..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Monthly Climatology Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: N-Factor Values and Air and Ground Surface Temperatures, Kuparuk River Basin, Alaska. ABSTRACT: This data set includes ground surface temperatures and air temperatures measured at ten study plots within the Kuparuk River basin of north-central Alaska. Computed thaw-season 'n-factor' values are also included (the n-factor is defined as the ratio of the sum of thawing degree days at the soil-surface to that in the air). Data were collected in an effort to evaluate differences between air and ground-surface temperatures associated with different natural landcover types, and to assess the utility of the 'n-factor' concept as a tool in geocryological mapping. Detailed descriptions of field procedures and assumptions are provided in Klene (2000) and Klene et al. (2001)..

TITLE: Natural spatial subsidies in continental Antarctic soil. ABSTRACT: The soils of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are hypothesized to rely on external sources of nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, etc). The importance of these spatial subsidies on productivity and biological diversity of dry valley soils was investigated over several seasons in the Garwood Valley. Sampling of the soil, microbial mats and foam from each identified landform and from Lake Colleen was undertaken for analysis of a variety of soil biological and chemical properties in order to gain an idea of the general spatial variation of these properties (before experimental work) and to determine the size of the soil microbial communities, the rates of microbial respiration and the abundance of selected invertebrate groups. Soil samples were collected and analysed to quantify carbon and nitrogen pools, potential decomposition and nitrogen release under optimal conditions and potential microbial use of a variety of test C and N substrates. The importance of spatial subsidy materials on the four different landforms was tested with the addition of lakeshore foam and algal mats at two levels of application, plus appropriate treatment controls. Pre-treatment soil samples were taken for a variety of chemical analysis to establish baseline parameters. After subsidy applications, field measurements were made of the short -term changes (over the first six days after treatment application) in in-situ microbial activity and the composition of gases being released into the atmosphere. After six days, a second set of soil samples were collected for post treatment measurements of soil community composition and diversity, potential microbial activity and decomposer processes. Soil samples were again taken 2 years later for medium term respiratory processes but also for laboratory controlled replicate experiment for in-situ confirmation of initial nitrogen limitation and later carbon limitation. Studies were in the 01 02, 02 03 and 04 05 seasons in the Garwood Valley..

TITLE: ASTER On-Demand L2 Polar Surface and Cloud Classification. ABSTRACT: The ASTER On-Demand Level-2 Polar Surface and Cloud Classification product provides a classification map discriminating between different surface and cloud features over polar areas. The product aims to classify the cloud and snow-ice spectral signatures in both the visible and infrared wavelengths. The current algorithm works with data acquired during the daylight hours. An algorithm for night-time data will follow. This product will assist those studying greenhouse forcings in the polar regions where cloud cover exerts its effects on sea ice conditions, the regional ice-albedo feedbacks, the polar heat balance, and surface melting. This product will provide data used in cross-validating the MODIS cloud optical thickness and effective particle sizes, both of which impact the Earth's radiative budget. The ASTER On-Demand Level-2 Polar Surface and Cloud Classification product uses an hierarchical algorithm executed in four stages: In the first stage, the VNIR data are sub-sampled by half (15 m to 30 m) while the TIR data are sampled three times (90 m to 30 m). The SWIR data at 30 m are retained in their original resolution. The VNIR and SWIR digital numbers (DN) are normalized for solar irradiance, solar zenith angle, observation angle, and calibration coefficients. The TIRDNs are converted to temperature. In the second stage, the data are pre-classified to reduce the class ambiguity of a pixel's feature vector by using key features like coastline data, land-water mask etc. The third stage involves the use of a back-propagation neural network to aid in the resolution of feature vectors to one of nine possible classes. In the fourth stage, a spatial consistency test is performed on the classification mask and pixels deemed to be spatialy inconsistent with their neighbors are re-classified. The final product is a coded pixel map containing the following thematic classes: [1] water [2] snow ice [3] ice cloud [4] land [5] thin water cloud [6] water cloud over water [8] sea ice [12] water cloud over land [30] bare ground tundra Data Set Characteristics: Area: ~60 km x 60 km Image Dimensions: 4200 rows x 4980 columns File Size: ~42 MB Units: Thematic Projection: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Data Format: HDF-EOS Vgroup Data Fields: 1.

TITLE: USGS Seafloor Side-Scan Sonar Imagery of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), Surveyed Using GLORIA. ABSTRACT: In March 1983, President Reagan signed a proclamation establishing an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending the 200 nautical mile from the coasts of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. territories and possessions. In 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began a program to map these areas of the EEZ To accomplish the mapping of the deepwater portion (depths greater than 400m) of this area, the USGS selected the long-range sidescan sonar system GLORIA (Geological LOng-Range Inclined Asdic). At that time the GLORIA system was owned and operated by British colleagues at the United Kingdom's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS), now the Southampton Oceanography Centre, Challenger Division. The GLORIA system was developed specifically to map the morphology and texture of seafloor features in the deep ocean. The GLORIA system is a digital sidescan sonar system capable of producing digital image maps of the seafloor from reflected sound waves. The sidescan sonar system was used aboard the research vessel R V FARNELLA and is shown with the GLORIA fish mounted on the stern of the ship. GLORIA creates images (sonographs) that are a record of the acoustic backscatter from the ocean floor. These images are created by transmitting a series of sound pulses and recording their echoes from the sea floor as the collecting ship moves along a set course. The sound source and receivers are built into a "fish" that is towed about 200 meters behind a ship. This electronic mapping system emits a signal (pulse) every 30 seconds. The pulse travels through the ocean to the bottom where it is partly absorbed and partly reflected by the seafloor. The returned signal is then recorded by shipboard computers. In general, the returned signal is recorded in a range of 0-255 with strong returns recorded as higher values and weak returns recorded as lower values. The darkness or brightness of a feature or an area on the sonographs and completed mosaics is therefore a function of how much sound is reflected from the seafloor. The USGS selected sidescan sonar as the mapping tool because it could be used to obtain information on geologic processes. The intensity of the back-scattered sound from the seafloor is a function of the gradient or slope of the seafloor, of the surface roughness, and of the sediment characteristics such as texture. Another advantage to the GLORIA system was because the system provides information from a swath of seafloor, large areas could be mapped quickly. More detailed information and specifications of the GLORIA-II system is available from Somers and others (1978). The GLORIA imagery provides the first broad-scale view of sea-floor features and the effects of sedimentary processes that have been unknown or poorly known until recently. These data are a unique set of basic information that will support many future studies by government, academic, and industry workers. The recorded digital data are processed and used to construct digital maps of the seafloor such as the one shown (Gulf of Mexico mosaic #13). Seafloor variation is depicted by the light and dark areas representing the high and low returned signal values, and can be interpreted by a geologist. http:  coastalmap.marine.usgs.gov gloria index.html.

TITLE: Hydrologic Sub-basins of Greenland. ABSTRACT: The Hydrologic Sub-basins of Greenland data set contains Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon shapefiles that include 293 hydrologic sub-basins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as created by Lewis and Smith (2009). Five km Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of ice-surface and bedrock topography (Bamber et al. 2001) were used to estimate the hydraulic potentiometric surface for Greenland, which accounts for the effects of ice overburden pressure, such as hydrostatic pressure, surface topography, and underlying bedrock topography (Paterson 1994). Using the 5 km potentiometric grid, a modeled basin network for Greenland's ice sheet was created using the hydrological tools within ESRI ArcGIS (ArcInfo 9.2). Although the GIS initially generated more than 293 basins, basins less than 100 km2 in size, as well as basins located completely outside of the ice sheet extent, were removed from the dataset. Data are available via FTP, and can be read in any GIS software. The following journal article provides documentation for this data set: Lewis, Sarah and Laurence Smith. 2009.

TITLE: ERS-1 2 Radar Altimeter Sea Surface Height Modes Product. ABSTRACT: The Sea Surface Height Model (SSH) product is a digital data set consisting of a global set of sea surface height point values with respect to a particular reference ellipsoid on a regular equiangular geographical grid. The product is based on ERS-1 2 OPR Altimeter data, processed and compiled at F-PAF, and the D-PAF precise orbits. Two different sea surface height model versions are produced. The stationary solution, a most reliable estimate of a long period (mean) sea surface height model and short period solutions, representing the sea surface for a limited time period. Product characteristics: --------------- Spatial Coverage: global, however, due to the ERS-1 2 inclination the latitude range is limited to about <+82, -82> Spatial Resolution: depends on product version as well as on repeat cycle. The stationary model has a grid spacing of 6' (corresponding to a spatial distance of some 11 km at the equator. SHort period SSH's will have a grid spacing of 15' (corresponding to a spatial distance of some 28 km at the equator), depending on a sufficient input data coverage (repeat cycle). Time Coverage: depends on product version. The stationary model will cover a time period that is as long as the acquisition period of the level 2 records available at D-PAF. The time coverage of short period SSH is one cycle of the 35-day repeat orbit. Reference System: sea surface height refer to wgs84 ellipsoid. Time Rate of Generation: the stationary model is generated every 6 months. The first time it is produced when 6 months of level 2 altimeter data for the 35 days repeat cycle are available. The short period solutions are produced every month (for 3 day repeat cycle), or every new complete repeat cycle. ---------------------- To order data please see "http:  earth.esa.int helpandmail help_order.html".

TITLE: Aerial Photography Summary Record System. ABSTRACT: [from Aerial Photography Summary Record System Fact Sheet 220-96 (August 1998), http:  clic.npolar.no disc disc_datasets_metadata.php?s=0&desc=1&table=Datasets&id=DISC_GCMD_EARTH_LAND_USGS_APSRS&tag=All&Category=&WCRP=&Location=All&stype=phrase&limit=10&q= Introduction. The Aerial Photography Summary Record System (APSRS) describes aerial photography projects that meet specified criteria over a given geographic area of the United States and its territories. Aerial photographs are an important tool in cartography and a number of other professions. Land use planners, real estate developers, lawyers, environmental specialists, and many other professionals rely on detailed and timely aerial photographs. Until 1975, there was no systematic approach to locate an aerial photograph, or series of photographs, quickly and easily. In that year, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) inaugurated the APSRS, which has become a standard reference for users of aerial photographs. Contents. There are two data bases in the system: the APSRS data base and the contributor data base. Each record in the APSRS data base contains up to 13 descriptive fields. All fields can be displayed, and 12 of the 13 fields can be searched. Not all fields, however, contain data for every record. Each record in the contributor data base contains the name, address, and phone number of a contributor. The contributor field and the field containing the city, State, and zip code can be searched. The APSRS data base describes more than 600,000 aerial photography projects covering the United States and its territories. A number of Federal, State, and municipal agencies and commercial firms contribute to APSRS. Each listing is a summary of aerial photography projects within a 7.5- by 7.5-minute quadrangle area, corresponding to the USGS 7.5-minute map series. Entries are sorted by project date and describe the scale, project code, file type, cloud cover, and camera focal length. The entries also give the name of the holding agency or firm. Requirements. Hardware requirements include an IBM PC-XT-AT or compatible microcomputer with 512 kilobytes of memory, with DOS operating system version 3.0 or greater; one 20-megabyte hard drive; and a CD-ROM reader with software drivers that read ISO-9660 formatted CD-ROM&#039;s..

TITLE: Model Output of Active Layer Depth in the Arctic Drainage Basin, 1979-2001. ABSTRACT: Investigators applied the Frozen Ground Model to the entire Arctic Drainage Basin to create this data set of active layer depth (ALD), recorded in centimeters. This model has been shown to provide excellent results for active layer depth and soil temperatures when driven with well-known boundary conditions and forcing parameters at specific locations. The model is driven by 2-meter air temperatures from the ERA-40 European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis. The reanalysis data are provided on a N80 reduced Gaussian grid, which is symmetric about the Equator with 80 latitudinal points in each hemisphere. Data represent a subset of the entire 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) for the Northern Hemisphere (721 x 721 = 39,926 grid cells). There are monthly files for 23 years, 1979-2001, with a daily time step. Data are in space-delimited ASCII text format, and are available via FTP..

TITLE: GLDAS VIC Land Surface Model L4 Monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V001 (GLDAS_VIC10_M) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model in the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The data are in 1.0 degree resolution and range from 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. This simulation was forced by combination of NOAA GDAS atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET). The simulation was initialized on 1 January 1979 using soil moisture and other state fields from a GLDAS VIC model climatology for that day of the year. WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The following table shows a list of parameters, their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units.

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: This 31 X 43" full-color poster is publication MGG-5R from the Marine Geology and Geophysics Division of the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center. This image was generated from digital data bases of seafloor and land elevations on a 2-minute latitude longitude grid (1 minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile, or 1.853 km). Assumed illumination is from the west; shading is computed as a function of the east-west slope of the surface with a nonlinear exaggeration favoring low-relief areas. A Mercator projection was used for the world image, which spans 390 degrees of of longitude from 270 West eastward to 120 East; latitude coverage is from 80 degrees North to 80 degrees South. The resolution of the gridded data varies from true 2-minute for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean floors and all land masses to 5 minutes for the Arctic Ocean floor. Major data sources are as follows: for Ocean Areas between 72 degrees North to 72 South latitude, bathymetry is derived from satellite altimetry of the sea surface; poleward of 72 degrees, data are from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. Land Topography is primarily from various sources collected and gridded at 30 minute resolution by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, US Department of Defense.

TITLE: Coarse Fraction Grain Size Analyses, East Coast and Arctic Canada. ABSTRACT: Analysis of grain size to determine the percentage of grains in a sediment that are coarser than 1 single grain size e.g. >63, >125, or >150 microns from marine core samples collected as part of research cruises conducted by, or for, the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic). This is a type of grain size data. Grain size is a fundamental means of characterizing seabed sediment. Seabed sediment may be named according to its grain size. Grain size analysis of marine sediment samples?is a valuable method of determining: the source of the sediments (i.e. whether they were derived from land and blown out to sea; whether they were deposited by oceanic currents or delivered by glaciers or icebergs); the energy level at the seabed under modern conditions (e.g. is?it quiet enough for fine-grained sediments to be deposited or are fines winnowed away?leaving only coarser-grained sands and gravels behind?); the energy level?in the past when sediments below the seabed were deposited, based on down-core analysis of grain-size; the strength and stability properties of the sediments and their response to loading. Sands, clays and silts all behave very differently under loads. Even a small amount of fines can make a sediment unstable so grain size is a crucial part of doing a geotechnical investigation of soil stability. The same applies for: assessing the stability of a slope under wave-, or sediment- or seismic- loading; the potential for pollutants or contaminants to be deposited or transported; to determine whether sediments will be eroded and or transported under the effects of bottom currents that may be produced during tidal fluctuations or severe winter storms.This is a basic analytical tool used to further scientific research in the areas of sedimentology and paleoceanography. Grain size influences the mobility, stability and physical properties of sediment, has an important impact on the associated biota, and can be used to interpret the origin and behaviour of seabed sediment.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 2 Global Area Coverage (GAC), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Merged LAC (MLAC) Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global satellite measurements by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS acquires approximately 15 pole-to-pole orbital swaths of data per day, and approximately 90% of the ocean surface is scanned every two days. SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The Level 2 data products consists of geophysical values that are generated from Level 1A data by applying sensor calibration, atmospheric correction, and bio-optical algorithms. The resolution is the same as the corresponding level 1A Local Area Coverage (LAC, 1 km resolution), and Global Area Coverage (GAC, 4 km resolution) products. Unusual conditions may be flagged on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Before computing Level 2 data, pixels are eliminated if they contain clouds, sun glint, or other abnormalities. For pixels that pass these screens, an atmospheric correction is applied to subtract the atmospheric scattering components from the total radiance to obtain the water-leaving radiances for bands 1-5 (see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov VALIDATION atm.html). See http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?SEAWIFS_LEVEL_1A for additional information about Level 1A data. SeaWiFS Standard Level 2 Products: -Normalized water-leaving radiances at 412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm. -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm (for atmospheric correction). -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm (for atmospheric correction). -Chlorophyll-a concentration. -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm Level-2 processing is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSl12) code, which is developed and maintained by the OBPG. MSL12 is used for the standard processing of all ocean products distributed through the web browsers and FTP sites. This software is capable of retrieving oceanic optical properties and various derived products from the observed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances collected by a variety of ocean remote sensing radiometers. Full documentation, updated code source, sensor files, and output product descriptions can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MSL12 . Ancillary meteorological data (U and V winds, surface pressure, water vapor) and Ozone data (O3) are used for atmospheric correction in Level 2 processing. EPTOMS Ozone is the primary source for ozone used within OBPG. The Ancillary Data is Quality Controlled and made available to the public by FTP from the Ocean Color Web Site. Other Level 2 processing steps include data navigation so that land mask may be correctly placed, computational steps to derive the geophysical products, and tests for anomalous conditions in the data (masks and flags).

TITLE: Estimates of Sea Ice Floe Velocities Characterizing Whaling Seasons Using Satellite Imagery of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, Spring 2000 and 2001. ABSTRACT: This data set formed the basis for estimating sea ice floe velocities covering two spring whaling seasons with markedly different rates of success from March to June in 2000 and 2001 in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas near Barrow, Alaska. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the RADARSAT and the European Remote Sensing Two (ERS - 2) satellites and broadband visible (VIS) and infrared (IR)images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite were used. Sea ice floe velocity and sea ice reflectance are the parameters used in this data set. The temporal resolution of these images were from one to seven days with a mean of three days. The spatial resolution was 30 m to 1.6 km. These images were georeferenced and reproduced in Microsoft PowerPoint format; thus, PowerPoint is necessary to view these images. Data and browse images are available via FTP..

TITLE: Determination of the thermal conductivity of sea ice from measurements of ice temperature (and temperature gradients), salinity, ice microstructure and other environmental parameters. ABSTRACT: The polar oceans' sea ice cover strongly modifies ocean-atmosphere heat transfer. Despite its importance, existing circulation models and large scale sea ice models include overly simplistic parameterizations of the ice thermal conductivity that are likely to contribute to significant errors in estimating ice production rates. A set of field measurements in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and Barrow, Alaska, were conducted over 5 seasons from which the thermal conductivity of first year sea ice was derived as a function of ice microstructure, temperature (and temperature gradients), salinity and other environmental parameters. Thermistor arrays were deployed in fast sea ice near the Erebus Glacier Tongue to allow measurements of temperature over small volumes with the sensor in direct contact with undisturbed ice grown around it. Data was recorded at 10 min intervals throughout the winter and spring. To estimate thermal conductivity from this data set, an array of dielectric probes were deployed which allow the derivation of the in situ brine volume fraction and bulk ice salinity in the respective ice horizons. In addition, an ice coring programme was conducted to characterise ice properties and heat flow processes over a larger area. Eleven sites were visited with measurements at each including snow and ice characterization and temperature profile measurements. Ice cores were sectioned on site into 5-10cm segments and melted, salinity measurements and sub-sampling for stable-isotope measurements, study of crystal and pore microstructure completed. To extend surface observations, backscatter signatures in Radarsat Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery was analysed. In addition, a set of laboratory based thermal conductivity measurements were made on cores drilled out of large blocks cut from the array sites. Surface and sub-surface first year ice and multi year surface ice were characterised by density and salinity measurements and photographed. The thermal conductivity of the cores was measured in a specifically constructed thermal conductivity measuring apparatus..

TITLE: Global Snow-Water-Equivalent Depth Coefficient-of-Variation Classification. ABSTRACT: This data set provides a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories and a coefficient of variation applicable to each category, as the result of the Subgrid SNOW Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that defines subgrid snow-depth and snow-cover variability. This data set provides the distribution of those nine categories and their coefficient-of-variation values on a global, 2.5 arc-min latitude-longitude (approximately 5-km) grid. The time period covered is 1 January 1994 through 1 January 2004. The SSNOWD submodel was formulated to improve the depiction of autumn through spring land-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks within global weather, climate, and hydrologic models. From both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient-of-variation (CV). Using an understanding of the physical processes that lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned to each category based on published measurements. Data are in binary format..

TITLE: R-ArcticNet: A Regional Hydrographic Data Network for the Pan-Arctic Region. ABSTRACT: This comprehensive river discharge database on CD-ROM for the entire pan-Arctic drainage system uses data from 3713 gauges and contains monthly river discharge data extending from the 1890s (for four Canadian and five Russian gauges) through the early 1990s. The length of record for individual gauges is extremely variable, but most records cover years between 1960 and 1990. The pan-Arctic drainage region covers a land area of approximately 21 million km2 that drains into the Arctic Ocean as well as Hudson Bay, James Bay and the Northern Bering Strait, including the Yukon and Anadyr Rivers. Most of the drainage basins used were greater than 15,000 km2. For Canada and Russia the collection includes all available river gauges. The gauges for large drainage areas are of the greatest interest to the regional, continental and global-scale scientific community for modeling purposes. The data set was developed at the University of New Hampshire..

TITLE: Biodiversity, molecular phylogeny and evolution of marine algae from the Arctic and the Antarctic. ABSTRACT: With the International Polar Year (IPY 2007-2008) coming soon, a number of scientists from many countries are planning and carrying out various and important research projects cooperatively concerning polar sciences. At this critical period, we are planning to carry out our research whose theme is the marine algal biodiversity, molecular phylogeny and evolution. The environmental changes of polar areas are clearly observed at a large scale and accelerated, and have a serious effect on the earth. The serious environmental changes influence the existence and distribution of algae, primary producers so directly and greatly that the research of these phenomena is required urgently. In our research, we will study algae from the Arctic and the Antarctic. We try to grasp the diversity of species with the investigations of the Bangiales, Corallinales and Ceramiales in the Rhodophyta, which have a comparatively long history of evolution, and the Desmarestiales, Laminariales and Sphacelariales in the Phaeophyceae, known as recently evolved. We will also carry out DNA barcoding of the mitochondrial COI, analyze their morphological data, reveal their phylogenetic relationships based on multi-gene sequence data including nuclear SSU and ITS rDNA, plastid rbcL-S (including RuBisCo spacer), and ultimately clarify distributions and evolutionary mechanisms of endemic and widely distributed algae. The aim of our research is to grasp the diversity of algae which live in the Arctic and the Antarctic with the thorough interpretations of all the results, suggest a new taxonomic systems on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships, and reconstruct the history of their distributions and evolutions from the viewpoint of the movement of the continents and distributions of organisms..

TITLE: Level 3.5 time-averaged VAM analyses of ocean surface wind velocity over 30-days (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov products product079.html ). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com  ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao  ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used ( http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata  ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR ( http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets  ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. The Level 3.5 data products are derived from time averaged Level 3.0 gridded VAM analyses over 5-day and monthly periods. Only those grid points with one or more analyzed observations are used in the average. Monthly means starting on the first day of each month. The level 3.5 data sets are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF, http:  hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu ). All observations are mapped to a 25 km grid and packed into 1-byte integers. Data distributed in NetCDF format ( http:  www.unidata.ucar.edu software netcdf  ). All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s. Each data set is archived using the following naming convention: NAME_YYYYMMDD_vVVlLLPPP.TTT.gz where NAME - unique identifier describing the data YYYYMMDD - date time expressed as year, month, day VV - product version number (in tenths) LL - product level designation (in tenths) PPP - product stream (flk or llk) TTT - file type designating the data format For example, "monthly_20040101_v10l35flk.nc.gz" designates a level 3.5 (l35) data set containing 30-day means for January 1, 2004 from version 1.0 (v10) of the first-look (flk) product stream in NetCDF (.nc) format. The ".gz" node indicates that the file must first be de-compressed using the GNU zip (gzip) compression utility..

TITLE: Geological investigations, triangulation surveys and glaciology investigations of the Upper Tucker Glacier area, North Victoria Land, and around Scott Base. ABSTRACT: Intensive geological work was conducted in the Tucker Glacier area of North Victoria Land. The work area overlapped the Geological Survey of the 1957-58 Expedition and this was helpful to correlate rock types, standardisation of nomenclature, etc. Every opportunity was taken to observe the more distant rocks from high peaks and on air flights. Three major rock types were found to occur in this region and extensive collections were made from the following: i) 49 specimens of Robertson Bay type greywackes, slates, red argillites, grits, etc including a number of orientated samples, ii) 15 specimens from the Tucker Granodiorite, iii) 26 Xenoliths from the Tucker Granodiorite, iv) 69 specimens from the contact zone of the Tucker Granodiorite with the Robertson Bay Group, v) 32 specimens of various hyperbyssal rocks from occurrences in granodiorite, greywacke and quartzite and vi) 45 specimens from a new formation of quartzites discovered. A total of 236 specimens were collected. Time was also spent working in the vicinity of Scott Base examining McMurdo Volcanics. Samples were collected of the typical extrusive rocks of the area, fairly rare quartzose xenoliths from the olivine basalts and limburgitic basalts of the area, olivine nodules from certain basalts, hydrothermally altered basalts and nodules from the sulphur cones area and gabbroic xenoliths from the basalts. In addition, a number of soil samples and a considerable number of lichens were collected and several snow pits were dug and morphological features of the glaciers and Polar Plateau noted. Field surveys were conducted to provide ground control in the form of a triangulation network with heighting. The survey achieved a triangulation network over an area of about 3,000 square miles..

TITLE: New England Lakes Terrigenous Inwash and Holocene Paleostorm Data, NOAA NCDC WDC Paleoclimatology. ABSTRACT: [Abstract] For the purpose of detecting the effects of human activities on climate change, it is important to document natural change in past climate. In this context, it has proved particularly difficult to study the variability in the occurrence of extreme climate events, such as storms with exceptional rainfall. Previous investigations have established storm chronologies using sediment cores from single lakes, but such studies can be susceptible to local environmental bias. Here we date terrigenous inwash layers in cores from 13 lakes, which show that the frequency of storm-related floods in the northeastern United States has varied in regular cycles during the past 13,000 years (13 kyr), with a characteristic period of about 3 kyr. Our data show four peaks in storminess during the past 14 kyr, approximately 2.6, 5.8, 9.1 and 11.9 kyr ago. This pattern is consistent with long-term changes in the average sign of the Arctic Oscillation, suggesting that modulation of this dominant atmospheric mode may account for a significant fraction of Holocene climate variability in North America and Europe..

TITLE: GLDAS VIC Land Surface Model L4 3 Hourly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V001 (GLDAS_VIC10_3H) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) Model in the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The data are in 1.0 degree resolution and range from 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is 3-hour. This simulation was forced by combination of NOAA GDAS atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET). The simulation was initialized on 1 January 1979 using soil moisture and other state fields from a GLDAS VIC model climatology for that day of the year. WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number.

TITLE: Mooring and Drifting Buoy Data: Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Experiment, 2003. ABSTRACT: In the summer of 2003, investigators established an observational program to measure the freshwater content (in sea ice and in the ocean) of freshwater fluxes in the Beaufort Gyre using moorings and drifting buoys. They collected temperature time series, salinity, current, sea ice draft, and bottom pressure measurements. Investigators used conventional mooring systems containing a McLane Moored Profiler (MMP) to sample currents and hydrographic data from 50 m to 2050 m with 17-hour time intervals. They measured sea ice draft with an ASL Environmental Sciences 420 kHz upward-looking sonar (ULS). Using a high accuracy bottom pressure recorder (BPR), they measured sea level height variability and near-bottom seawater temperatures. Each mooring consisted of a surface floatation package at 50 m depth, which housed the ULS, a mooring cable containing the MMP, and dual acoustic releases and a BPR located immediately above the anchor. Investigators also deployed several ice-tethered beacons to provide concurrent temperature and salinity data at several discrete depths in the uppermost 40 m. The instruments suspended three SeaBird MicroCat C T recorders and data were broadcast via the Argos data collection relay system, which also provided the drifter location..

TITLE: Diversity and DNA barcoding of the brown algae around the Dasan Station in the Arctic. ABSTRACT: The case studies presented here indicate that cox1-5 barcoding will be a powerful ally in the identification of brown algal species in the Arctic. In all cases intraspecific divergence values ranged from 0 to 5 bp, whereas interspecific divergences > 20 bp were usually observed. The DNA marker successfully assigned collections to the correct species and resolved a reasonably well-supported phylogeny of mitochondrial haplophytes in the Laminariales. The desmarestialean and laminarialean algae were compared in terms of morphology and mitochondrial cox1 sequence data among each order worldwide. Diversity and phylogeny of the Laminariales based on the cox1 sequence data indicate that there are five Laminaria species around the Dasan Station in Svalbard, the Arctic and one of them are new species candidates based on their morphology and DNA sequence data. Our data indicated that the mechanism of evolution in representative brown algae around the Arctic is not simple. It is therefore, in need of a thorough phylogenetic and biogeographic investigation of them. In our further researches, we will investigate brown and red algae from the Arctic and the Antarctic. We try to grasp the diversity of species with the investigations of the Bangiales, Corallinales and Ceramiales in red algae, which have a comparatively long history of evolution, and the Desmarestiales, Laminariales and Sphacelariales in brown algae, known as recently evolved. We will also carry out DNA barcoding of the mitochondrial cox1, analyze their morphological data, reveal their phylogenetic relationships based on multi-gene sequence data including nuclear rDNA, plastid rbcL-S, and mitochondrial cox1, and ultimately clarify distributions and evolutionary mechanisms of endemic and widely distributed algae..

TITLE: MMS Ship Transect Survey for Mammals and Seabirds, Southern California Bight. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Marine Mammal and Seabird Surveys of The Southern California Bight Studies: -- So. Calif. Bight Ship Surveys [Birds and Mammals] Study Code: SS Contract Number: AA550-CT7-36 Principal Investigator(s) Affiliation: K. S. Norris and B. J. Le Boeuf, University of California, Santa Cruz, and G. L. Hunt, University of California, Irvine. PURPOSE: OBJECTIVES: Objectives of the study were to characterize the marine mammal and seabird fauna of the Southern California Bight, estimate abundance of species, describe the distribution, determine the timing and routes of migrations and movements, and document seasonal changes in numbers or patterns of habitat-use. In addition, studies were conducted to determine the size and status of breeding colonies of seabirds and pinnipeds, their productivity, and trends in growth. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: May 1975 through March 1978 STUDY AREA: The Southern California Bight, from Point Conception to the U.S.-Mexico boundary and offshore to the 2,000 m isobath. METHODOLOGY: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals. Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range. DATABASES PRODUCED: Databases produced include 1) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 24 *low-altitude aerial surveys, 2) sightings of cetaceans on 35 high-altitude aerial surveys, 3) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 29 ship transect surveys, and 4) sightings of cetaceans on 34 catch cruises. Included in this database are the following: High Altitude Mammal Observations: 75,489 km of effort, 695 sightings of 68,557 individual animals Low Altitude Mammal Observations: 37,843 km of effort, 1,320 sightings of 15,070 individual animals Low Altitude Bird Observations: 35,445 km of effort, 7,950 sightings of 63,359 individual animals Ship Observations: 17,903 km of effort, 23,519 sightings of 181,287 individual animals CURRENTNESS REFERENCE: ground condition SPATIAL REFERENCE INFORMATION - GEODETIC MODEL Horizontal Datum Name: D_WGS_1984 Ellipsoid Name: WGS_1984 Semi-major Axis: 6378137.000000 Denominator of Flattening Ratio: 298.257224.

TITLE: Active Layer and Borehole Temperatures from La Foppa Rock Glaciers, Val Vallaccia, Central Italian Alps. ABSTRACT: The La Foppa site is a glacial cirque located in the upper part of the Val Vallaccia, near Livigno, in the Italian Central Alps. The La Foppa cirque is characterized by five rock glaciers, of which four are active and one is of uncertain activity or is inactive. These rock glaciers, especially the two largest, named La Foppa I and La Foppa II, have been the subject of geophysical investigations (Lozej and Guglielmin, 1992; Guglielmin et al., 1994; Guglielmin 1997) including BTS measurements (bottom temperature of snow; more than 70 measurements between 1990 and 1993) and STG measurements (shallow temperature of ground in summer) (Calderoni et al. 1993; Guglielmin and Tellini 1992, 1994; Guglielmin 1997). The distribution of BTS and STG measurements indicate that above 2800 asl the permafrost is continuous whereas below this elevation it is constrained inside the rock glaciers, where it is not continuous. Three boreholes have been established. One is in the frontal part of La Foppa I where the BTS values are always lower than -3 degrees C, and where the active layer detected with vertical electrical soundings (V.E.S.) ranges from 0.8 to 2.7 meters. The second borehole is in the central part of La Foppa I, where the BTS values range between -0.5 and -2.1 degrees C, and the V.E.S. indicate an active layer of 3 - 5.5 meters thick. The third borehole is located on the moraine ridge (of Late Glacial age) at 10 meters of the lateral slope of La Foppa I that overlaps the moraine ridge. Here the BTS values and V.E.S. point out the absence of permafrost. Near the third borehole there is a meteorological station that measures air temperature at 4 meters above the ground, snow cover, snow temperature every 20 cm up to 420 cm, precipitation, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and soil temperature at 2 and 30 cm depth. Borehole data are recorded on data loggers. A sample of the data is presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM. In this data file, data values must be divided by 10 to obtain the correct value..

TITLE: Arctic Regional Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ARC-MIP) at UCAR JOSS NOAA CODIAC. ABSTRACT: An international intercomparison of 5 regional model simulations in the Arctic will be conducted using a common forcing dataset. The Arctic Modeling Intercomparison Project (ARC-MIP) will focus on the SHEBA year. The rationale for selecting this period is that high quality data are available from SHEBA, the ARM Barrow site, aircraft observations and several satellite remote sensing. In addition, extensive data are available from the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS), a series of large-scale hydrological and related atmospheric and land-atmosphere studies to be conducted within the Mackenzie Basin in Canada. Each of the modeling groups will focus on a different aspect of the model intercomparison, but there are some broader goals which can be addressed by this project including better understanding of processes and process parameterizations, model uncertainty and global climate model circulation simulations.

TITLE: Influence of Mean Climate Change on Climate Variability from a 155-year Tropical Pacific Coral Record from WDC Paleoclimatology. ABSTRACT: [Summary from the online data description "ftp:  ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov paleo coral west_pacific readme_maiana.txt"] This data set is a 155-year ENSO reconstruction from a central tropical Pacific coral that provides new evidence for long-term changes in the regional mean climate and its variability. A gradual transition in the early 20th century and the abrupt change in 1976, both towards warmer wetter conditions, co-occur with changes in variability. In the mid-late 19th century, cooler drier background conditions coincided with prominent decadal variability; in the early 20th century, shorter-period (~2.9 years) variability intensified. After 1920, variability weakens and becomes focused at interannual time scales; with the shift in 1976, variability with a period of about 4 years becomes prominent. Our results suggest that variability in the tropical Pacific is linked to the region's mean climate, and that changes in both have occurred during periods of natural as well as anthropogenic climate forcing. Sampling and isotopic analysis: Cores (8.5 cm diameter) drilled from living coral colonies were slabbed and X-rayed to identify annual density bands and optimal sampling transects. Samples were drilled along the growth axis continuously at 1mm resolution. Stable isotopic analysis (d18O and d13C) of powdered samples was performed on a Micromass Optima with Isocarb automated preparation system at the University of Colorado's Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research. Analytical precision is =10.08 d18O and =10.05 d13C. The Maiana record is continuous except for a gap from 1901-1905, which we bridged through straight forward comparison and splicing of data from a coral record from nearby Tarawa Atoll..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Yearly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution (DBDB-V) from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). ABSTRACT: The Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable resolution (DBDBV) is a digital bathymetric data base that provides ocean depths at various gridded resolutions. DBDBV was developed by NAVOCEANO to support the generation of bathymetric chart products, and to provide bathymetric data to be integrated with other geophysical and environmental parameters for ocean modeling. Grid resolutions available include 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 minutes of latitude longitude (1 minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile or 1.852 km). For data coverage for each resolutions see Related URLs below. The data base for DBDBV consists of four file types. The depth information is expressed in meters, uncorrected at an assumed sound velocity of 1500 meters per second. The first file is a Master Index File that contains a pointer or byte address to each populated one degree cell for each of the resolutions available. The second file is an Index File that provides a linkage to the detailed depth values, as well as, a linkage to a description file associated with the depths. The third file, or Description File, provides details on the compressions, scaling and storage of the depth information. The fourth file is the Data File that contains the depth values for a on degree cell of a specific resolution. The geographic coverage of the 5 minute gridded bathymetry of the current version of DBDBV includes all ocean areas and adjacent seas above 78 degrees South latitude to 90 degrees North latitude.

TITLE: The First Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE-I) and the Meteorological Measurement System (MMS) Data CD-ROM's. ABSTRACT: The first CD-ROM contains the Second Edition of data pertaining to the First Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE-I) which was based in Stavanger, Norway during January and February, 1989. The First Edition of this dataset, produced in March 1990, was corrupted by many data errors introduced during production of the CD-ROM. The form of the errors was a random conversion of characters to spaces but hopefully the random data errors are not present in this edition. The second CD-ROM contains all of the 5 Hz data from the ER-2 Meteorological Measurement System (MMS) taken during the 1989 AASE-I associated with flights during which mesoscale disturbances were observed. This disc was generated as an appendix to the primary AASE-I CD-ROM dataset. The data consists of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, ozonesonde soundings from three stations (Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, Greenland, and Lerwick, U.K.), aerosol and temperature profiles from the SAM II spacecraft, global grid point values of Nimbus-7 TOMS ozone, and selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the region of the experiment. This expedition was aimed at studying the production and loss mechanisms of ozone in the north polar stratospheric environment, and the effect on ozone distribution of the Arctic polar vortex and of the cold temperatures associated with the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC). The mission was organized and funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, universities, Chemical Manufacturers Association, and meteorological agencies overseas, utilizing similar instrumentation that was deployed during the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE) of 1987. Theory teams provided calculations of: potential vorticity along the ER-2 flight path; cross-sections of potential vorticity, temperature, and geopotential heights along the DC-8 flight path; cross-sections of Clx, Fx, HCl, HNO3, and NOy along the DC-8 flight path; global grid point values of temperature, geopotential heights, and horizontal winds on selected pressure surfaces; northern hemispheric grid point values of potential vorticity and pressure on selected potential temperature surfaces. Because of its limited range, the ER-2 is not be able to survey the entire Arctic region. The ER-2 measured ozone, chlorine monoxide, nitric oxide, reactive nitrogen, nitrous oxide, total water, bromine monoxide, nitric acid, condensation nuclei, aerosol size distribution, whole air sampling, and particle chemistry and size. The DC-8 can cover a greater range, enabling it to survey the polar vortex and air processed through the cold temperature region of the polar vortex. The DC-8 collected information similar to that of the ER-2, along with the vertical distribution of ozone and aerosols, methane, and in situ measurements of ozone. All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable length records terminated by <CR><LF> (ASCII decimal values 13 and 10). In general, the file naming convention uses a two character prefix to identify the measurement, followed by a six digit number giving the year, month, and day (GMT) of the flight (or balloon launch). To identify the measurement platform, a three character name as in ER2, DC8, or Bhh is used to denote the data is from the ER-2, DC-8, or balloon (hh denotes the GMT hour of launch). AASE-I discovered that while NOx and to some degree NOy were perturbed within the arctic vortex, there was little evidence for desiccation. Under these (in contrast to the antarctic) marginally perturbed conditions, however, CLO was found to be dramatically enhanced such that a large fraction of the available (inorganic) chlorine resided in the form of CLO and its dimmer CLOOCL. A follow-up phase, AASE-II, was conducted in 1991 and 1992..

TITLE: Cariaco Basin 50KYr Radiocarbon Calibration and Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: Cariaco Basin 50KYr Radiocarbon Calibration and Reconstruction. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14C data from planktonic foraminifera from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1002, cores 1002D and 1002E, Cariaco Basin (10 deg. 42.73'N, 65 deg. 10.18'W, 893m. depth) ABSTRACT (from the online documentation): A series of 14C measurements in Ocean Drilling Program cores from the tropical Cariaco Basin, which have been correlated to the annual-layer counted chronology for the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core, provides a high-resolution calibration of the radiocarbon time scale back to 50,000 years before the present. Independent radiometric dating of events correlated to GISP2 suggests that the calibration is accurate. Reconstructed 14C activities varied substantially during the last glacial period, including sharp peaks synchronous with the Laschamp and Mono Lake geomagnetic field intensity minimal and cosmogenic nuclide peaks in ice cores and marine sediments. Simulations with a geochemical box model suggest that much of the variability can be explained by geomagnetically modulated changes in 14C production rate together with plausible changes in deep-ocean ventilation and the global carbon cycle during glaciation.

TITLE: Active Layer Physical Processes at Broeggerhalvoya, Western Spitsbergen. ABSTRACT: These data have been collected from an Arctic desert site (latitude 78o57'29N, longitude 12o27'42E), Broeggerhalvoya in western Spitsbergen, 10 km NW from Ny Alesund, 45 m above sea level, 2 km from the shore. This is a low relief tip of a bedrock peninsula covered with several meters of glacial drift and reworked raised beach ridges. The measurements are obtained in the site of well developed patterned ground, sorted polygons, where the influence of plants, including thermal insulation and transpiration, is negligible. The 1985-1986 period was average. Mean annual air temperature was -6.6 C, 0.4 C colder than the long-term (1975-1990) mean, but well within the mean variability. Mean winter air temperature is relatively warm (mean of coldest month, February, is -14.6 C). Annual precipitation was 17 % greater than the long-term mean (372 mm); however, the number of rain-on-snow events was less (3) than average (5.5). Overall, the reference period is close to long-term averages. A program of automated soil temperature recordings was initiated in the summer of 1984, at a patterned ground field site Thermistors were placed approximately 0.1 m apart in an epoxy-filled PVC rod (18 mm outside diameter), buried in the center of a fine-grained domain of a sorted circle, down to 1.14 m below the ground surface. The data presented here covers 7 1 85-7 1 86, once a day (6 am), at two levels (0.0 m, 1.145 m below surface). The resolution of the thermistors is 0.004 C, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.02 C near 0 C. Missing data accounts for less than 7 %. The gaps are filled with simple average of the beginning and end of the gap values. For a detailed description of the field site and data analysis see Putkonen (1997) and Hallet and Prestrud (1986). These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998..

TITLE: Barents Sea Plankton Data. ABSTRACT: Barents Sea Plankton Data: 1952 - Present Day In the early 1950's, PINRO initiated annual plankton research expeditions. PINRO regularly conducted 3 surveys a year. To obtain good material on the most abundant plankton species - Calanus and Euphausiacea - surveys must be carried out at different times, using different fishing gear. Mesoplankton were surveyed during summer and autumn when copepods develop intensively and all age groups are concentrated in 0-50m. Juday net(gauze #38, opening size 37cm) with a locker was used for sampling. Plankton were fished in the vertical regime at 0-50m, 50-100m, 100-200m and 200-bottom. Macroplankton were surveyed in winter when all age groups of Euphausiacea are concentrated in the near bottom layers and can be sampled using one set of fishing gear. The net (gauze #140, opening size 50cm) was fastened on the headline of a fishing trawl. The net was used to fish macroplankton in the horizontal regime 6-10m from the bottom at 2.5 n.miles hr, filtering 1000m3 of water. All materials obtained are annually processed, recorded on special forms together with the data on sampling conditions and abiotic factors and stored in the PINRO Laboratory of Marine Biology. In the laboratory, samples are examined with a binocular microscope at 2x8 magnification and copepods are counted in the random camera. The samples are statistically and graphically processed. The objective of this work is to reveal the regularities of formation of the Barents Sea Plankton community and to investigate its role in water trophicity. The activities include investigations of interannual dynamics of plankton related to advection of Atlantic waters and consumption of plankton. The results of these theoretical investigations are used by PINRO in order to determine future food supply for different fishes and serve as a prognostic predictor in fisheries forecasting..

The Level-2B ocean swath product (AE_Ocean) contains Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at 56 km and 38 km resolution, near-surface wind speed at 38 km and 21 km resolution, columnar water vapor at 21 km resolution, columnar cloud liquid water at 12 km resolution, and quality flags. All variables were measured over oceans and are generated from the Wentz algorithm. The Level-3 daily product (AE_DyOcn), weekly product (AE_WkOcn), and monthly product (AE_MoOcn) include SST, near-surface wind speed, columnar water vapor, and columnar cloud liquid water over oceans in a 0.25 degree by 0.25 degree grid, generated from AE_Ocean. Data are stored in Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format, and are available from 19 June 2002 to the present via FTP..

TITLE: Time Series of Active Layer Thickness in the Russian Arctic, 1930-1990. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of active layer thickness (ALT) measurements based on soil temperatures in the Russian Arctic. The active layer is the top layer of ground that freezes in the winter and thaws in the summer over permafrost. Changes in ALT over northern high-latitude permafrost regions have important impacts on the surface energy balance, hydrologic cycle, carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface, plant growth, and ecosystem as a whole. Warming may thicken the active layer and induce permafrost thaw. Investigators collected data from 35 ground-based stations. Derived from monthly averages, the record includes annual maximum active layer depths from 1930 to 1990. Data are in tab-delimited ASCII text format and are available via FTP..

TITLE: Collaborative Research: Polar Experiment Network for Geospace Upper-atmosphere Investigations (PENGUIn) - A New Vision for Global Studies. ABSTRACT: This project will continue the operation of surface-based magnetometers, imaging and broadbeam riometers (relative ionospheric opacity instruments), and two-wavelength zenith photometers at South Pole and McMurdo stations in Antarctica, and imaging riometers at Iqaluit (nominally conjugate to South Pole) and Sondrestrom in the Arctic. Additionally, the data acquisition systems at South Pole and McMurdo for the common recording of other geophysical data, and the provision of these data to collaborating investigators will be continued. The Antarctic data sets are web-based, and can be accessed in near-real time. The continuation of the activities in the 2004-2006 time frame will contribute to several major science initiatives, including the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling), CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions), ISTP GGS (International Solar-Terrestrial Project Global Geospace Science), and National Space Weather programs. The overall objective of the project is to understand the relevant physical processes that produce the observed phenomena, and how they relate to driving forces, either internal, such as magnetospheric ionospheric instabilities, or external, such as solar wind interplanetary magnetic field variations. It is expected that this project will lead to an enhanced capability to predict sufficiently in advance the possible occurrence of events that might have negative technological or societal impacts, and thus provide time to lessen their effects..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Seasonal Climatology Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: UARS Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) Level 3AT V001 (UARHA3AT) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: The HALOE home page on the WWW is "http:  haloe.gats-inc.com home index.php". The Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) investigates upper atmosphere chemistry, dynamics and radiative processes, particlarly stratospheric ozone destruction and chlorofluromethane impact on ozone. HALOE is a solar occultation experiment designed to monitor the vertical distribution of HCl, HF, CH4, and NO by gas filter correlation radiometry and H2O, NO2, O3, and CO2 by broadband filter radiometry. The HALOE instrument typically views 15 sunrise and sunset events each day, scanning the solar disk from limb to limb during each event. The latitude longitude location of the HALOE data varies with the spacecraft-Earth-Sun position. For a given day, the locations tend to be in two distinct latitude bands and to sweep across the full longitude range. Coverage across the full range of latitudes is achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six weeks depending on the time of year. The latitude coverage extends from 80 degrees north to 80 degrees south. The HALOE level 3AT data consist of 13 granules per day. A data granule is one HALOE species or subtype per day. The following subtypes are available: 1) AEXTCH4 - aerosol extinction at 3.46 um (CH4 gas filter), 2) AEXTCO2 - aerosol extinction at 2.80 um (CO2 gas filter), 3) AEXTHCL - aerosol extinction at 3.40 um (HCL gas filter), 4) AEXTHF - aerosol extinction at 2.45 um (HF gas filter), 5) AEXTNO - aerosol extinction at 5.26 um (NO gas filter), 6) CH4 - methane, 7) H2O - water vapor, 8) HCL - hydrogen chloride, 9) HF - hydrogen fluoride, 10) NO - nitric oxide, 11) NO2 - nitrogen dioxide, 12) O3 - ozone, and 13) TEMP - atmospheric temperature. Aerosol extinction coefficients are measured in units of 1 km, chemical species are given in parts per million by volume (ppmv), and temperature is in units of degrees Kelvin. Each of the 13 HALOE granules is accompanied by 2 additional parameter files, designated as level 3TP. The first parameter file, subtype LAT, contains the latitude values for each pressure level of each event for the day. The second parameter file, subtype LON, contains the longitude values. The level 3AT files only contain the latitude longitude location corresponding to the 30 km retrieval point. The HALOE level 3AT data product consist of profiles that have been interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS project for all limb-viewing instruments. The level 3AT format is common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison. The level 3AT data product consists of time-ordered profiles, and are spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or about 495 km along the tangent track (horizontal resolution). The vertical resolution for the level 3AT HALOE profiles is defined by the UARS pressure levels (in mbars) given by: P(i) = 1000 * 10**(-i 6) for i = 0, 1, 2, ... which gives approximately 2.5 km increments between pressure surfaces..

TITLE: Fuel Model Algorithm Refinement and Model Validations for Eastern US Tree Species. ABSTRACT: Field data are collected to evaluate for modeled estimates of live and dead aboveground woody forest biomass and develop correlations among fire-related vegetation and biophysical parameters. To increase confidence in our biomass estimation approach, we compare our model-derived estimates with eastern FIA database forest biomass variables. One component of this evaluation examines the accuracy and variability associated with current aboveground live woody biomass estimates, employing the FIA plot-level (P2) dataset, which consists of approximately 77,500 plots (48,000 of those being forested ) and 1,300,000 trees located across the southeastern region. Our estimates of dead woody biomass are evaluated against a subset of approximately 900 FIA P3 plots inventoried by the FHM Program. The purpose of the data is to assess species composition, abundance and distribution of the infauna of the Arctic Canada Basin..

TITLE: Seawater Chemistry from the North Pole Environmental Observatory, 2000-2004. ABSTRACT: This data set includes diverse measurements of seawater chemistry along with supplementary conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD); pressure; salinity; potential temperature; and density data from the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole. Measurements were taken from sea ice platforms each April from 2000-2004. Investigators used a CTD-O2 system to measure seawater conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen content, and collected Niskin bottle samples for measurements of salinity, oxygen isotope composition, and concentrations of phosphate, silicic acid, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and barium. The available in situ dissolved oxygen measurements were collected beginning in 2002. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year. More information about the project is available at the project Web site, http:  psc.apl.washington.edu northpole  (North Pole Environmental Observatory). These data are available via FTP..

TITLE: Canadian Snow Data. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Daily Snow Depth Database consists of daily ruler measurements of snow depth taken by Meteorological Service of Canada observers and archived as daily element 013 in the National Climate Data Archive. The depth data also include a substantial number of daily and weekly snow depth observations rescued from paper records as part of a CRYSYS-sponsored data rescue project. The depth data extend from the late 1800's to early 1996 in the database, although most of the data are in the period after 1950. A detailed quality control procedure was applied to flag suspicious values and fill missing data. The data were written in a direct access database which includes all the data available at the time the project was completed in 1997 (data from some stations go to the end of April 1996, but most data end in December 1995). Daily snow depth data from the National Climate Data Archive have been included on the CD-ROM for the 1996-1999 period to provide users with the capability of updating information to the end of the 1998 1999 snow season. These additional data have only been subject to MSC standard quality control checks. The Canadian Snow Water Equivalent Database contains snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth measurements from snow surveys taken by more than twenty agencies at weekly, biweekly or monthly frequencies. It also contains biweekly SWE estimates at Meteorological Service of Canada snow depth observing stations. The data cover the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s, with a pronounced peak in the 1976-1985 decade. After 1985 there was a steep decline in the amount of data due to closure of snow courses and an erosion of contacts between MSC and other data collection agencies. At peak levels in the early 1980s, there were over 1700 snow course observations per year in the database. This number declined to around 800 per year in the early 1990s. In many cases, updates to the snow course data contained in this CD-ROM can can be readily obtained from the various provincial agencies involved in taking snow surveys. Links to these organizations are provided in the contract report for the Snow Water Equivalent Database. The CD-ROM is mainly intended as a data archive and extensive data extraction and analysis tools are not provided. The CD-ROM does contains some sample FORTRAN 77 software for data summary and extraction. All software is provided uncompiled and may have to be modified to operate on different platforms. The code was originally written for a PC-DOS system using a Microsoft FORTRAN Powerstation 4.0 compiler. Complete CD-ROM documentation including descriptions of data sources, data-modeling techniques, quality control, sample products, filenames, file locations and file formats is located in contract reports prepared by Robert Braaten for MSC. There are currently no plans to provide regular updates to this CD-ROM. This CD-ROM is dedicated to the field staff who participated in the collection of these data, and to the managers who understood the importance of sharing data. Hopefully this data compilation will do justice to these individuals and will prove to be useful in furthering understanding of snow cover in Canada.This CD-ROM was created by the Climate Processes and Earth Observation Division, Climate Research Branch, Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) with the objective of making Canadian snow data more readily available to the user community.

TITLE: Younger Dryas Paleoclimate Data; GISS, NY. ABSTRACT: Younger Dryas Data - Paleoclimate Evidence of Rapid Climate Change Evidence of past climate change provides a historical perspective from which we may view our present and future climate. Records derived from ice cores, lake, bogs, ocean sediments, and glacial moraines indicate that our climate has changed considerably over the last 20,000 years. As paleoclimate techniques have improved and enhanced resolution magnifies our view, it is now obvious that the climate has changed frequently and rapidly in the past, both from warm to cold conditions and from cold to warm. The most prominent of these reversals is the Younger Dryas cooling that was first discovered in Europe, and occurred refers to the Arctic-Alpine flower, Dryas. Fossils of this plant and other tundra indicators were found sandwiched between sediments that indicated warmer, forested environments.) We may ask, does closer scrutiny of this event tell us anything that is relevant to our future? We know that describing the past patterns of change will aid us in understanding how rapidly vegetation can respond to climate change, and ultimately, what may be causing change. Studies at GISS have resulted in the discovery of a similar event in North America. This event has now been examined in three lakes and swamps in southern New England, using a combination of pollen stratigraphy, macrofossil stratigraphy, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) techniques. We are looking closely at the patterns of vegetational change in the rapid warming and cooling modes. In the northeastern U.S., the Younger Dryas event is regionally apparent from pollen records that indicate a change from a mixed hardwood deciduous forest (oak, ash, spruce, fir) to a boreal assemblage (spruce, fir, larch, birch, alder) as seen in pollen zones A-3 and A-4 in the first figure. Subsequently, the pollen assemblage dramatically reverses, as the boreal components disappear and, first, white pine, then oak, dominates. This pattern of pollen assemblage zones is recorded in over 20 sites in the northeastern U.S. Three questions were asked concerning this change in regional pollen stratigraphy to determine whether this change represented a climatic change similar to that found in Europe: (1) Does this palynological change represent a real change in vegetation, as opposed to a change in wind direction? (2) Was the vegetational change due to changes in climate? (3) What were the timing and rate of the vegetational change? To determine whether the palynological change represented a true vegetational change, sediment samples were screened for macrofossils (leaves, needles, seeds), which give a more precise determination of the species involved. In addition, macrofossils are important because, although pollen may blow long distances, the macrofossils indicate the actual vegetation at the site. The results of this detailed analysis indicated that the distribution of boreal trees indeed expanded during this interval, and that trees with such northerly distributions as paper birch replaced warmer species such as white pine. The winters during this time must have been severe, as increased alder and paper birch indicate disturbance. The magnitude of the change in the NY-CT-NJ region was a cooling of about 3 to 4 xC annually, and the snow depth was probably considerably more than present. Extreme winters probably left gaps in the forest that were filled by light-demanding paper birch and alder. Determination of the timing of the dramatic northeastern U.S. cooling and the subsequent warming is important for correlation with the European event, as well as for comparison with ice core and marine records, and other regional land records. The macrofossils were submitted for AMS dating to Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California, where analysts there are able to determine the (14)C age of a single spruce needle. Results of the dating indicated that the cooling occurred between 11,000 and 10,000 years ago, which proves that the event here in southern New England is the same as that in Europe, in the Greenland ice cores, and in North Atlantic marine records. From the 5-cm detailed analysis of the sedimentation rates in the sediment cores, estimates of the regional vegetational change rates were made. The best estimates are that the climate change at the onset of the cooling took place over about 100 to 200 years. The close of the Younger Dryas cooling, typified by a vegetation change from boreal trees to a warmer white pine and oak forest, took place over an interval of between 50 and 150 years. From the macrofossil changes, it is evident that trees such as spruce, fir, and paper birch became locally extinct at the time of this rapid warming, and have remained absent from this region for the past 10,000 years. This dramatic and rapid change is comparable to that predicted for future greenhouse warming, and is comparable to the report of a very sharp transition (50 to 100 years) for this period in the Greenland ice cores. With two data points in-hand, it is now reasonable to inquire as to the global distribution of this event. At GISS, we are continuing to assess the available evidence for this reversal worldwide through continued literature compilation as well as field work. If indeed the methane and carbon dioxide decreases in the ice cores are linked in age to the Younger Dryas interval, it means that the event was global, because these gases are distributed rapidly in the atmosphere. Based upon North Atlantic evidence of cooling, in 1986 we reported the GCM results of the effects of a colder North Atlantic over land regions adjacent to the North Atlantic, as shown in the second figure, which agrees with terrestrial paleoclimatic evidence from the North Atlantic region. However, we are continuing to assess reports of the Younger Dryas in locations further afield, specifically with a research program of glacial geology and palynology at high latitudes, including Kodiak Island, Alaska. Results from Kodiak Island suggest that glacial advances and vegetational changes characterized the interval from 11,000-10,000 years BP. We are currently identifying the vegetational changes during this period, but it appears that a major regional cooling did take place roughly during this time interval, as evidenced by the decline of warmth-demanding ferns and the increase of tundra. Additional AMS dating of macrofossils should tell us whether a major change took place that is correlative with the Younger Dryas of Europe and eastern North America. We are continuing our modeling efforts from the latest data-model interaction. We have conducted additional GCM experiments using new marine data that indicate a 2 xC cooling in North Pacific sea surface temperature during the Younger Dryas. The resulting annual air temperature difference between today and this experiment is quite large throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including the air temperature over North America and Europe. This result is significant because it points to the tremendous impact of the large area of the North Pacific Ocean on northern hemispheric climate when the temperature is lowered, as less moisture in the air results in less of a greenhouse warming effect. We continue to delve into the questions of the distribution, timing, magnitude, and vegetational expression of this rapid and major climate event of the past. By analyzing its effects regionally and globally, we will be in a better position to define the cause of such rapid climate changes, and our future. for more information, see: http:  www.giss.nasa.gov research paleo  and http:  pubs.giss.nasa.gov authors dpeteet.html.

TITLE: Measurement of the characteristics of the intensity and polaristion of skylight at two different sites in Antarctica, differeing in albedo. ABSTRACT: The enhancement of UVB radiation falling onto the different land surfaces was investigated. Previous measurements (in the 1990 season) found low maximum polarisation of sky light and strong low azimuth back scattered light as two characteristic features of the Antarctic skies. Analyses of these features suggested that this occurs by multiple reflections from the snow-ice surfaces surrounding the Tent Island measuring site (and most of Antarctica). To test the theory that the distinctive features of skylight over ice (and snow) is due to the high albedo environment, two sites at essentially the same latitude and the same unpolluted air were measured to determine if the land surface was what was affecting the results. Enhanced UVB radiation was measured, and hence the properties of Antarctic skies, at two sites, one near Tent Island and the other at Lake Vanda, the first site being surrounded by sea ice, while the second site was surrounded over a substantial distance by bare rock. Using a sky monitor and polarisation spectrometer, the polarisation and sky light distribution was measured at both sites..

TITLE: MMS Low Altitude Survey for Seabirds, Southern California Bight. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Marine Mammal and Seabird Surveys Of The Southern California Bight Studies: -- So. Calif. Bight Low Aerial [Birds] Study Code: SB Contract Number: AA550-CT7-36 Principal Investigator(s) Affiliation: K. S. Norris and B. J. Le Boeuf, University of California, Santa Cruz, and G. L. Hunt, University of California, Irvine. PURPOSE: OBJECTIVES: Objectives of the study were to characterize the marine mammal and seabird fauna of the Southern California Bight, estimate abundance of species, describe the distribution, determine the timing and routes of migrations and movements, and document seasonal changes in numbers or patterns of habitat-use. In addition, studies were conducted to determine the size and status of breeding colonies of seabirds and pinnipeds, their productivity, and trends in growth. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: May 1975 through March 1978 STUDY AREA: The Southern California Bight, from Point Conception to the U.S.-Mexico boundary and offshore to the 2,000 m isobath. METHODOLOGY: Aerial and ship surveys were conducted along pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Aerial surveys were conducted at two altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) alternating at 2-3 week intervals. Seabirds and pinnipeds were recorded only on the low-altitude surveys which predominantly sampled along eight lines of latitude, separated by 25 nm, and connecting lines of longitude. High-altitude surveys sampled cetacean abundance along 15 Loran lines oriented northeast-southwest and separated by 12-15 nm. On low-altitude surveys, seabirds were counted only within a 50 m corridor on the shaded side of the aircraft. Marine mammals were counted in an unbounded corridor on one side of the aircraft on low-altitude surveys and both sides of the aircraft on high-altitude surveys. A clinometer or marks on the wing-strut were used to estimate the declination, and the measurement or estimate later used to calculate probability density functions of frequency with right-angle distance. Ships were used for surveys of inshore waters along standard (i.e., predetermined and replicate) transects and for search, catch, and tagging tracking of small cetaceans. The standard ship transect cruises sampled abundance of seabirds and marine mammals over banks, basins, and ridges in waters inshore of the Patton Escarpment (the shelf break). Seabirds and marine mammals were counted on both sides of the cruise track and distance estimated or measured with a range-finder. Catch cruises attempted to find and remain with schools of common dolphin and other small cetaceans; therefore, data on sightings from these cruises cannot be used as samples of animal abundance. The Southern California Bight Study also included ground and aerial censuses of pinniped and seabird colonies, and special studies of productivity, mortality rates, and foraging range. DATABASES PRODUCED: Databases produced include 1) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 24 *low-altitude aerial surveys, 2) sightings of cetaceans on 35 high-altitude aerial surveys, 3) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 29 ship transect surveys, and 4) sightings of cetaceans on 34 catch cruises. Included in this database are the following: High Altitude Mammal Observations: 75,489 km of effort, 695 sightings of 68,557 individual animals Low Altitude Mammal Observations: 37,843 km of effort, 1,320 sightings of 15,070 individual animals Low Altitude Bird Observations: 35,445 km of effort, 7,950 sightings of 63,359 individual animals Ship Observations: 17,903 km of effort, 23,519 sightings of 181,287 individual animals CURRENTNESS REFERENCE: ground condition SPATIAL REFERENCE INFORMATION - GEODETIC MODEL Horizontal Datum Name: D_WGS_1984 Ellipsoid Name: WGS_1984 Semi-major Axis: 6378137.000000 Denominator of Flattening Ratio: 298.257224.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Variations in Circumpolar Frozen Ground Conditions and Modeled Future Conditions. ABSTRACT: This data set contains permafrost distribution maps, active-layer thickness maps, and hazard-potential maps constructed using results from the 'frost index' permafrost model (Nelson and Outcalt, 1987) driven by modern climatic data and scenarios of climate change derived from three transient general circulation models (Greco et al., 1994). The permafrost maps show the distribution of permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere under modern climatic conditions and General Circulation Model (GCM) projections for 2050; the active-layer thickness maps show relative changes in the depth of seasonal thawing projected for 2050; and the hazard-potential maps are used as indices to evaluate potential environmental hazards associated with thaw settlement and thermokarst..

TITLE: Aerial Surveys of Marine Birds and Mammals in Support of Oil Spill Response and Injury Assessment. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Aerial Surveys of Marine Birds And Mammals In Support Of Oil Spill Response And Injury Assessment Studies: -- OSPR Aerial Surveys [Birds and Mammals] Study Code: OS Contract Number: FG7407-OS with California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR); and 14-35-0001-30758 (Task 13293) with the Coastal Marine Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR(S) AFFILIATION: Michael L. Bonnell, Ph.D. Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz PURPOSE: OBJECTIVES: Develop and maintain a capability to provide aerial surveys of marine bird and mammal distribution and abundance for oil spill response and post-spill injury assessment. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: June 1994 through October 1998 STUDY AREA: Coastal and inland marine waters of California. METHODOLOGY: Aerial surveys were conducted in a variety of California locales with experienced observers and trainees. The aircraft used was a Partenavia PN68 Observer provided by the Department of Air Services, CDFG, flown at an altitude of 200' (60m) above ground level and at a typical air speed of 90 kts. Two observers (at least one experienced) occupied middle seats and searched a corridor of 50m on each side of the aircraft. Width was defined by clinometer and simple trigonometric functions. Species, numbers, behavior and other information was described on hand-held tape recorders for later transcription and computer entry. The co-pilot position was occupied by a navigator computer operator. This individual recorded number of observers on-watch, transect status (i.e., on-effort, off-effort, and commutes), as well as sea state, weather and other observation conditions. Date, time, and position of the aircraft were recorded directly into the data-logging computer with time, latitude and longitude provided by a Global Positioning System (GPS). DATABASES PRODUCED: A single database was produced including date, time, latitude longitude, behavior, observation conditions, and other information for each sighting of marine birds, mammals, and turtles. As stated above, some surveys were solely for the purpose of drills and training, some for systematic data collection, and others for actual oil spill response. In this study, 74 one-day surveys were flown through 1997. Through the end of 1997, a total of 670 hours were flown and, exclusive of commutes, mapped bird and mammal distribution and abundance along 31,271 km (16,886 nmi) of transects. (data from several surveys from 1998 are yet fully analyzed and therefore not included on this CD-ROM.) Credit for this study is shared with OSPR by the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Pacific OCS Region, that provided most observers for surveys flown in Santa Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria Basin; MMS personnel also carried out tape-transcriptions and computer entry for surveys in southern California waters (this portion of the OSPR surveys was conducted under matching-funds between OSPR and the Coastal Marine Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara).

TITLE: Physical-Geographical Regions Classifications. ABSTRACT: When the Ministers of the Arctic countries adapted the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) in 1991, they signalled out habitat conservation as an area for special attention. Consequently when the International Working Group for the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) met at its inaugural meeting in 1992, it included Arctic habitat conservation as a priority in its Work Plan. Norway, on behalf of the eight Arctic countries, accepted the task of examining the current status of habitat protection within the Arctic countries as the first phase of CAFF's long-term strategy on habitat. Physical-geographical regions as compiled for the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) project.

TITLE: Susceptibility of arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virsus (IHNV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). ABSTRACT: Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) are important viral fish pathogens that can cause high levels of mortality in populations of intensively cultured fish. These viruses can infect various life stages of salmonid and, in the case of IPNV, nonsalmonid fishes, and fish that survive primary infection can be lifelong virus carriers. Both IHNV and IPNV can be readily transmitted between generations and among contemporary generations. Empirical observations and experimental evidence indicate that species susceptibility is greatest in brook trout, followed respectively by rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, and Atlantic salmon. Information was obtained from "http:  www.lsc.usgs.gov SPN.asp?StudyPlanNum=01068-08" Information about other Leetown Science Center research projects is available at "http:  www.lsc.usgs.gov rescurrent.asp".

TITLE: PIROP Northwest Atlantic. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The PIROP (Programme Intégré de recherches sur les oiseaux pélagiques) data set, Atlantic subset, consists of geo-referenced vessel-based surveys to monitor pelagic seabirds. Most surveys were carried out by R.G. B. Brown from 'vessels of opportunity' supplied by the Bedford Institute for Oceanography (BIO) in Dartmouth Halifax, but many other platforms and observers were used, too. During these surveys observations other than seabirds were also recorded, e.g. Waterfowl, Waterbirds, Songbirds, Raptors, Owls, Sea Mammals, and other sightings of interest (weather, oceanography, vessel activities, bird behaviour, etc.). The data collection period covers all seasons of 1966-1992, with most surveys being conducted between (late) summers of 1975-1987. The survey protocol originally consisted of unlimited width 10min transects, but was changed appr. 1984 towards a Tasker et al. (1984) type of survey (fixed-width strip transect). However, data and results from the PIROP database need to be interpreted as relative, and not absolute, abundance. PURPOSE: The PIROP data were collected for Canadian seabird monitoring purposes, focusing on the Canadian Atlantic, but also on other areas relevant to Canadian birds such as waters off Peru, off West Africa and off Europe. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Puffinus creatopus (Pink-footed Shearwater; ITIS: 174547) observed on 1982-08-16 12:00:00 at 53.9000:-55.5000 (id=151664) changed to Procellariidae (Shearwaters; ITIS: 174532) as P. creatopus does not occur in the Atlantic. The PIROP data set is a large pool of seabird data, which got extended and modified over the years, e.g. due to changes of objectives and staff. Appr. in 1998 the data were merged by CWS-Dartmouth office with the Manomet Bird Observatory Seabird database, which cover mostly the Gulf of Maine region.

The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: LAII Alaska Landscape Flux Survey NOAA ATDD Long-EZ Aircraft Data. ABSTRACT: The data in the aircraft portion of the Land Atmosphere Ice Interaction (LAII) Alaska Landscape Flux Survey (ALFS) were collected in June 1994, June 1995, August 1995, and June 1996. The object of the effort was to measure remote sensing variables, the vertical flux density of sensible and latent heat, CO2, and momentum for extrapolating surface-based measurements to regional scales. The aircraft operations were conducted from Deadhorse Airport near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and consisted of daytime and nighttime transect flights. The measured parameters included water vapor, sensible heat, CO2, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), and surface reflectances from the Alaskan North Slope tundra, and were used to study the factors that control spatial variability of the exchange. Scalar flux densities were measured with a resolution of approximately 2-3 km. Supporting meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, CO2 and H2O concentrations, wind speed and direction, surface temperature, incoming and net radiation were also observed. This study was conducted with the National Science Foundation and San Diego State University..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m, Version 5. ABSTRACT: The MODIS Aqua Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m (MYD10_L2) data set contains snow cover and Quality Assessment (QA) data, latitudes and longitudes in compressed Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format, and corresponding metadata. Latitude and longitude geolocation fields are at 5 km resolution while all other fields are at 500 m resolution. Version 5 (V005), the latest version of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data available has two separate snow fields. The first field, snow cover, classifies each cloud-free land or inland water body pixel as snow-covered or snow-free, the second field, fractional snow cover, provides the percent of snow cover within each pixel for land and inland water bodies. MODIS snow cover data are based on a snow mapping algorithm that employs a Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other criteria tests. Data are stored in HDF-EOS format, and are available from 4 July 2002 to present via FTP. Data can also be obtained in GeoTIFF format by ordering the data through the Data Pool..

TITLE: Vegetation and Site Characterization, 1998-99 ATLAS Grid Transect, Northern Alaska. ABSTRACT: This data set comprises the text and data presented in the data report "A western Alaskan transect to examine interactions of climate, substrate, vegetation, and spectral reflectance: ATLAS grids and transects, 1998-1999." The report is a compilation of data from two projects conducted on the North Slope of Alaska during the summers of 1998 and 1999. The first project involves environmental, climate, soil, vegetation, and remote-sensing data collected from 8 ATLAS (Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System) grids established along a North-South transect from Barrow to Ivotuk, Alaska. The original purposes of the study were (1) to characterize the major zonal vegetation types found along the North Slope climate gradient, (2) to quantify differences between acidic and non-acidic tundra along the same gradient, and (3) to investigate relationships between plant biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This part also includes a brief analysis of interactions between plant functional type composition, LAI, NDVI, and summer temperature. This analysis is limited to moist acidic tundra (MAT) and moist non-acidic tundra (MNT) comparisons using data from six of the eight grids that best represent acidic and non-acidic mesic vegetation. The second project is an accuracy assessment of a Landsat MSS-derived landcover map of northern Alaska, which involved creating several large transects over northwest Alaska. Included here is a table of LAI measurements from eight random points along these transects, as well as the accompanying releve and site factor data sheets. No analysis of these data is presented..

TITLE: The Coastal Gulf of Alaska Circulation Model (3-km grid). ABSTRACT: The SALMON Project is currently utilizing the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) to run numerical simulations of the circulation of the coastal Gulf of Alaska. The model in use is called the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), developed jointly by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles and Rutgers University. It is run at a resolution of three kilometers and aligned in a nested grid configuration with Al Hermann's North East Pacific (NEP) domain. Open boundary conditions are provided by the NEP model and COADS monthly mean wind fields are used for the surface forcing. Tidal forcings are computed from Mike Foreman's northeast Pacific Ocean high-resolution assimilating tide model (Foreman et al., 2000) and are applied along the open boundaries of the model domain. Fresh water inputs consist of a continous line source of monthly mean values computed by Tom Royer's hydrologic model (Royer et al., 2001). The latest ROMS model run simulated three idealized years of circulation in the northern Gulf of Alaska..

TITLE: Climate and Flux Data from Alaska Sites, 1998-2000. ABSTRACT: This data set contains climate, flux, and bulk density data from Ivotuk and Council (Seward Peninsula), Alaska, collected from 1998 through 2000. Surface energy and trace gas exchange measurements were made at each of the four Ivotuk sites using the eddy covariance technique. Three flux and climate towers operated at Council, Seward Peninsula, during 1999 and 2000. Two towers were located at the tundra and forest sites. The third tower was a mobile tower and during 1999 covered four different surface types: lowshrub, shrub, woodland, and burned tundra. During 2000, the mobile tower covered tall shrub, tundra ISS2, burned tundra, heath and shallow thaw lake. The data have been divided by surface type or site and by data type (flux or climate). The data set also includes mean bulk density measurements for soil layers, collected in 1999. Measurements were taken as part of the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System (LAII-ATLAS) program.

TITLE: X. Postal Codes by Federal Ridings (1996 Representation Order) File, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The Postal Codes by Federal Ridings File (PCFRF) provides a link between the six character postal codes and the federal electoral districts (1996 Representation Order). A federal electoral district (commonly referred to as a federal riding) is any place or territory entitled to return a Member of Parliament (MP) to sit in the House of Commons. The PCFRF is intended as a tool for use with administrative files containing postal codes. By using the postal code as a link, data from administrative files may be organized and or tabulated by federal riding. This PCFRF allows a link of more than 680,000 postal code records to the 301 federal electoral districts (1996 Representation Order). A reference guide is included. Catalogue Number: 92F0028XDB PCFRF update: 92F0028UDB ...for additional information visit our organization's web site.The postal code federal riding file was conceived as a tool for use with administrative files containing postal codes. By using the postal code as a link, data from administrative files may be organized and or tabulated by federal riding. Using this tool, federal government departments will be able to respond more quickly and easily to MPs requests for information about their ridings. For example, the number and value of contracts awarded to a particular riding could be summarized. The ridings where petition signatories reside could also be identified in order to notify the appropriate Members of Parliament. Conversely, the postal codes for a given riding could be identified for general mailings to constituents; however, it should be noted that some postal codes do straddle one or more riding boundaries.

TITLE: Morphometric Characteristics of Ice and Snow in the Arctic Basin: Aircraft Landing Observations from the Former Soviet Union, 1928-1989. ABSTRACT: This data set contains sea ice and snow measurements collected during aircraft landings associated with the Soviet Union's historical Sever airborne and North Pole drifting station programs. The High-Latitude Airborne Annual Expeditions Sever (Sever means North) took place in 1937, 1941, 1948-1952, and 1954-1993 (Konstantinov and Grachev, 2000). In Spring 1993, the last (45th) Sever expedition finished long-term activity in the Arctic. Snow and sea ice data were collected, along with meteorological and hydrological measurements (the latter are not part of this data set). Up to 202 landings were accomplished each year. The data set contains measurements of 23 parameters, including ice thickness and snow depth on the runway and surrounding area; ridge, hummock, and sastrugi dimensions and areal coverage; and snow density. The sea ice thickness data are of particular importance, as ice thickness measurements for the Arctic Basin are scarce. These data are a subset of those used to create the atlas Morphometric Characteristics of Ice and Snow in the Arctic Basin, self-published by Ilya P. Romanov in 1993, and republished by Backbone Publishing Company in 1995. Romanov provided these data to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in 1994..

TITLE: UK classical hydrographic station data set (1893-). ABSTRACT: Oceanographic data has been routinely collected by UK research and naval vessels since the beginning of the twentieth century. This data set, compiled by the ICES Oceanographic Data Centre, comprises some 90939 profiles. All of the profiles in this data set have been quality checked, cross-checked against original documentation, and all duplications removed. This data set is one of the most complete of its kind in the world; about 90 per cent of the data known to have been collected prior to 1970 have been 'rescued' and work will continue to rescue the remainder. The data set only includes the classical oceanographic parameters of temperature, salinity, nutrients, oxygen, pH, alkalinity, and chlorophyll a. In recent years, CTD data have been collected in a higher resolution form than water bottle data; these have been included in this data set in a reduced resolution water bottle form and merged with any available chemical parameters. The data comprising this data set have been collected in the shelf seas around the UK, the North Atlantic, the Norwegian Sea, the Barentsz Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the South Atlantic, the Southern Oceans, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the East Indian Archipelago (Indonesia).

TITLE: TOVS Pathfinder Path-P Daily and Monthly Polar Gridded Atmospheric Parameters. ABSTRACT: The TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) Polar Pathfinder (Path-P) data set consists of gridded daily and monthly Arctic and Antarctic atmospheric data derived from various NOAA satellites. TOVS Path-P daily files are available for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from 60∞ poleward at 100 km gridded spatial resolution in an Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid). TOVS Path-P monthly files are available for the Northern Hemisphere only from 60∞ poleward at 100 km gridded spatial resolution in EASE-Grid. Daily and monthly Northern Hemisphere data are available from January 1979 through current processing, and daily Southern Hemisphere data are available from July 1979 through current processing. Data were created from a modified version of the Improved Initialization Inversion Algorithm (3I) (Chedin et al. 1985), a physical-statistical retrieval method improved for use in identifying geophysical variables in snow- and ice-covered areas (Francis 1994). Variables retrieved from satellite-observed radiances for this product include atmospheric temperature, water vapor, skin surface temperature, total effective cloud fraction, cloud top pressure and temperature, solar zenith elevation, surface pressure, turning angle between geostrophic wind and surface stress over ice, emissivity, boundary layer stratification, and geostrophic drag coefficient. The algorithm used to generate these grids has been validated through comparisons with surface observations from the North Pole drifting meteorological stations (Schweiger et al. 1999). The complete TOVS data set is available via FTP in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). Users may also order subsets of the data for any of the parameters listed above or for specific spatial or temporal coverage. Subsetted data are available in binary format only through the Graphical Interface for Subsetting, Mapping, and Ordering (GISMO). Data users are encouraged to register before accessing the TOVS data. Registered users automatically receive release notes via e-mail containing notification of data manipulation or formatting modifications..

TITLE: National Scale Frameworks Hydrology - Catchments, Canada. ABSTRACT: Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data are standardized national coverages of commonly used geospatial data sets at the 1:1 000 000 scale. A variety of framework layers (e.g. hydrology, roads, railways, populated places) have been integrated so that their relative positions are correct. Hydrology (which includes coastline) is the base layer to which all others are fitted. In addition, the Atlas of Canada National Frameworks collection forms a base to which an increasing number of national scale thematic frameworks from other Federal Government agencies are integrated (e.g. ecological regions, census subdivisions). The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers,lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada. The product set for the hydrology theme consists of six groupings: - Drainage Network Skeleton - Waterbodies - Islands - Drainage Areas - Supplemental Drainage Features (Catchments, Hydrometric Gauging Stations and Station Basins) - Cartographic. The Catchments data set is part of the Supplemental Drainage Features group of features. This data set is a polygon coverage representing an approximate catchment area for each individual river segment and lake in the drainage network. Each catchment is coded to correspond to a flowline in the Drainage Network Skeleton dataset.The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National-Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

TITLE: Historical Methane (CH4) Record from the Vostok (Antarctica) Ice Core (157,000-26000 BP), in CDIAC, Trends '93. ABSTRACT: Atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4) have been derived from ice core data in Antarctica for nearly 160,000 years. The 2,083-m-long ice core taken by the Soviet Antarctica Expedition at Vostok (East Antarctica) has been analyzed for atmospheric CH4 concentrations from the Holocene (as recent as 2569 years BP) and back through that last glaciation and the previous interglacial period to the end of the preceding glaciation. Data show increased CH4 concentration during glacial-interglacial transitions at 150,000-133,000 years BP and at 18,000-9000 years BP. The Vostok ice core data was provided by D. Raynaud, J. Chappellaz, J.M. Barnola, and C. Lorius (Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environnement, France) and Y.S. Korotkevich (Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, Russia).

TITLE: Happy Valley Permanent Vegetation Plots. ABSTRACT: This data set includes environmental, soil, and vegetation information collected from 55 relevý plots at the Happy Valley research site along the Sagavanirktok River in northern Alaska. To complement formal relevý sampling of vegetation during the period July 18-27, 1994, the investigators described each study site (including site topography, surficial geology, estimated snow duration, soil moisture, thaw depth, and signs of disturbance, among other parameters) and collected soil samples adjacent to the relevý plots for laboratory analyses. Soil analyses include measurements of soil chemistry, pH, organic matter content, and texture (percentages of sand, silt, and clay). Ordination analysis displays relevý data in two-dimensional space according to species similarity. Results from ordination reveal that three environmental variables -- stability, exposure, and soil moisture -- significantly affect vegetation composition..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Daily Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Physical and Chemical Properties from Selected Expeditions in the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: This data collection includes measurements of temperature, salinity, conductivity, pH, and concentrations of silicate, oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphorus in the Arctic Ocean. The data were collected sporadically since 1950, from icebreakers, research vessels, and ice camps using traditional wire casts, CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts, and CTD rosette casts. Also included are positional data and, for some expeditions, derived measurements of oxygen, nutrients, and alkalinity. The data are in NODC .SD2 and .F022 formats. The purpose of this data collection is to preserve and distribute physical and chemical data from the Arctic Ocean that have been gathered through a cooperative international effort involving the United States, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Russia..

TITLE: AARI 10-Day Arctic Ocean EASE-Grid Sea Ice Observations. ABSTRACT: These gridded ice charts represent a reformatting of information contained in another data set, the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute's (AARI) 10 Day Digital Arctic Sea Ice Charts. AARI digitized Arctic sea ice concentration and stage of development charts as part of an international data exchange program. The AARI source charts, similar to operational charts distributed by the National Ice Center describing ice type and constitution, were developed from aircraft and satellite observations for shipping purposes, and provide extremely detailed information. Such data are particularly valued in process studies tracking the growth and recession of polynyas, or for looking at the preponderance of ice at certain stages of development in a particular area. NSIDC does not maintain the operational charts, but archives the AARI digitized version. However, the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) 10 Day Digital Arctic Sea Ice Charts were encoded in SIGRID (Sea Ice Grid) format, which assigns numerical values to ice parameters and records them at specific lat lon grid points. But due to the difficulties of visualizing, extracting and working with data in SIGRID, NSIDC is now providing AARI data in NSIDC's Equal Area SSM I Earth Grid. The EASE-Grid format makes it especially easy to compare observed ice concentrations or ice types with the same parameters derived from satellite data (such as ice concentrations from passive microwave sensors). AARI sea ice data in the EASE-Grid projection are gridded at a 12.5 km resolution, for both Western (24W to 110E) and Eastern (105E to 130W) sectors. Data extend from 1953 through 1990, and are available via ftp in compressed tar format. Postscript (.ps) files depicting coverage per year are also provided with the data..

TITLE: IABP-POLES 2-Meter Air Temperature Data Set [1979-1997]. ABSTRACT: The POLES Arctic Gridded 2-meter Air Temperature Data Set provides optimally interpolated 2-meter air temperatures on the EASE (Equal Area SSM I Earth) grid. 12-hourly "beta" fields have been analyzed from 1979 through 1997. The format of these files is as follows: grid point #, day * 10, AirT *100, then 4 flags that we have been using to check the dataset. The coordinates corresponding to each grid point can be found in the file latlon. Until recently the Arctic Ocean has lacked a systematic, accurate surface air temperature (SAT) data set. These fields of surface air temperature are essential for monitoring climate, assessing the environment, validating and driving model simulations and for input into studies of climate change. Martin and Muqoz (1997) have studied the accuracy of various gridded temperature data sets by comparing the values of each data set against measurements taken at the Russian North Pole (NP) drifting stations. A SAT analysis analyzed using optimal interpolation (OI) to combine buoy and land station data was also tested and found to have higher correlations with the measurements at the NP stations compared to the other gridded temperature data sets. The SAT data used to compute statistics and for the OI analysis are: 1.) Argos buoy data collected by the International Arctic Buoy Programme, 2.) North Pole manned drifting station data obtained from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia, and 3.) meteorological land station data obtained from NCAR, dataset 464.0..

TITLE: ARM North Slope Alaska, Radiation Measurements. ABSTRACT: The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is the largest global change research program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and developing models to better understand the processes that control solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere (especially in clouds) and at the earth's surface. The URL for the ARM Data Archive is "http:  www.archive.arm.gov ". The URL for general information about the ARM program is "http:  www.arm.gov ". The data stored by the ARM Archive includes numerous parameters about radiative flux, meteorology, water vapor and clouds. The North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean (NSA AAO) site is providing data about cloud and radiative processes at high latitudes. These data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic. The NSA AAO site is centered at Barrow and extends to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (to Oliktok). Radiation data at Barrow (C1) and Atqasuk (C2) are collected using many specialized instruments. Detailed information on each instrument is available at "http:  www.arm.gov docs instruments.html". The following list contains the instrumentation used and the data available for the Barrow and Atqasuk sites. Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). For complete information on the AERI, visit "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The AERI measures the absolute infrared spectral radiance (watts per square meter per steradian per wavenumber) of the sky directly above the instrument. The spectral measurement range of the instrument is 500 to 3300 wavenumbers(cm-1) or 20 to 3 microns. Spectral resolution is 1.0 cm-1. Instrument field-of-view is 1.3 degrees. A calibrated sky radiance spectrum is produced every 10 minutes. The AERI data can be used for (1) evaluating line-by-line radiative transport codes, (2) detecting  quantifying cloud effects on ground-based measurements of infrared spectral radiance, and (3) calculating vertical atmospheric profiles of temperature and water vapor. Primary measurements are (1) absolute infrared spectral radiance of the sky in units of watts per square meter per steradian per wavenumber; and (2) sky brightness temperature as a function of wavenumber in units of degrees Kelvin. Calculated quantities are (1) variance of sky infrared spectral radiance as a function of wavenumber and (2) vertical atmospheric profiles of temperature, potential temperature, mixing ratio, and relative humidity. At Barrow (C1), AERI data are available for 1998-09-22 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsaaerich1C1: channel 1 data nsaaerich2C1: channel 2 data nsaaeriengineerC1: engineering data nsaaerisummaryC1: summary data. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR or MFR). For complete information on the MFRSR, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The MFRSR takes spectral measurements of direct normal, diffuse horizontal, and total horizontal solar irradiances. These measurements are at nominal wavelengths of 415, 500, 615, 673, 870, and 940 nm. The measurements are made at a user specified time interval; typically this interval is about one minute or less, at the SGP site, the sampling interval is 20 seconds. From such measurements, one may infer the atmosphere's optical depth at the wavelengths mentioned above. In turn, these optical depths may be used to derive information about the column abundances of ozone and water vapor, as well as aerosol and other atmospheric constituents. A silicon detector is also part of the MFRSR. This broadband detector provides a measure of the broadband direct normal, diffuse horizontal, and total horizontal solar irradiances. These quantities are uncalibrated and reported in units of counts. An MFRSR head that is mounted to look vertically downward can measure upwelling spectral irradiances (at the same wavelengths as the MFRSR). In the ARM system, this instrument is called an MFR. At the SGP there are two MFRs; one mounted at the 10 m height and the other at 25 m. At the NSA sites, the MFRs are mounted at 10 m. The primary quantities measured by the system are: (1) the direct normal solar spectral irradiance, (2) the total horizontal solar spectral irradiance, and (3) the diffuse horizontal solar spectral irradiance. The measurements at each wavelength are made by a single filtered detector with a nominal 10-nm FWHM bandwidth. At Barrow (C1), MFR data are available for 1998-03-18 to present. At Atqasuk (C2), MFR data are available for 2000-04-25 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsagndmfr: ground-oriented MFR: upwelling radiances nsamfr10m: ground-oriented MFR: upwelling radiances at 10-m height nsamfrsr: MFRSR: downwelling irradiances Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. The Ground Radiation (GNDRAD) The GNRAD collection of radiometers provides continuous measurements of broadband shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) irradiances for upwelling components. For complete information on GNDRAD, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". At Barrow (C1), GNRAD data are available for 1998-04-06 to present. At Atqasuk (C2), GNRAD data are available for 2000-05-25 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsagndrad20s: 20-second upwelling radiation nsagndrad60s: 60-second upwelling radiation. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Normal Incidence Multi-Filter Radiometer (NIMFR). For complete information on the NIMFR, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". The NIMFR is a ground-based instrument that provides a time series of the shortwave spectral direct normal irradiance. Additionally, there is a broadband silicon detector that can crudely measure the direct normal broadband irradiance. These irradiance measurements can be used to infer clear sky aerosol optical depth and columnar abundances of ozone and water vapor. The NIMFR is one of a class of instruments known as sun photometers. The primary quantities measured by the NIMFR are direct normal spectral irradiances at six discrete wavelengths as well as a broadband measurement from the silicon detector. At Barrow (C1), NIMFR data are available for 1998-03-23 to present. At Atqasuk (C2), NIMFR data are available for 2000-04-16 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsanimfr: direct normal irradiances. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. The Sky Radiation (SKYRAD) The SKYRAD collection of radiometers provides continuous measurements of broadband shortwave (solar), longwave (infrared), and ultra violet irradiances for downwelling components. For complete information on SKYRAD, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments". At Barrow (C1), SKYRAD data are available for 1998-02-14 to present.

TITLE: Dynamics of Ice Streams: A Physical Statistical Approach. ABSTRACT: Ice streams are believed to play a major role in determining the response of their parent ice sheet to climate change, and in determining global sea level by serving as regulators on the fresh water stored in the ice sheets. Ice streams are characterized by rapid, laterally confined flow which makes them uniquely identifiable within the body of the more slowly and more homogeneously flowing ice sheet. But while these characteristics enable the identification of ice streams, the processes which control ice-stream motion and evolution, and differences among ice streams in the polar regions, are only partially understood. Understanding the relative importance of lateral and basal drags, as well as the role of gradients in longitudinal stress, is essential for developing models for future evolution of the polar ice sheets. In this project, physical statistical models are used to explore the processes that control ice-stream flow, and to compare these processes between seemingly different ice-stream systems. In particular, the Northeast Ice Stream in Greenland will be investigated. Geophysical models lie at the core of the approach, but are embellished by statistical modeling of various components of variability. One important component comes from the uncertainty in observations on basal elevation, surface elevation, and surface velocity. In this project, new observational data collected using remote-sensing techniques are used. The various components, some of which are spatial, are combined hierarchically using Bayesian statistical methodology. All these are combined mathematically into a physical statistical model that yields the posterior distributions for basal and surface elevations, surface velocity fields, and stress fields, conditional on the data. Inference based on these distributions is carried out via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, to obtain estimates of these unknown fields along with uncertainty measures associated with them..

TITLE: MODIS Terra Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m, Version 5. ABSTRACT: The MODIS Terra Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m (MOD10_L2) data set contains snow cover and Quality Assessment (QA) data, latitudes and longitudes in compressed Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format, and corresponding metadata. Latitude and longitude geolocation fields are at 5 km resolution while all other fields are at 500 m resolution. Version 5 (V005), the latest version of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data available has two separate snow fields. The first field, snow cover, classifies each cloud-free land or inland water body pixel as snow-covered or snow-free, the second field, fractional snow cover, provides the percent of snow cover within each pixel for land and inland water bodies. MODIS snow cover data are based on a snow mapping algorithm that employs a Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other criteria tests. Data are stored in HDF-EOS format, and are available from 24 February 2000 to present via FTP. Data can also be obtained in GeoTIFF format by ordering the data through the Data Pool..

TITLE: International Ice Patrol (IIP) Iceberg Sightings Database. ABSTRACT: The International Ice Patrol (IIP) collects information on iceberg activity in the North Atlantic. The IIP area of responsibility prior to 2006 was 40 to 52 degrees North latitude and 39 to 57 degrees West longitude. However, starting in 2006 and going forward, the IIP area of responsibility is 40 to 65 degrees North latitude and 39 to 57 degrees West longitude. Data files contain latitude and longitude of sighted icebergs. Iceberg size classes are coded, as well as date and time of sighting, last date sighted, number of days on plot within the observation area, and several fields pertaining to the iceberg's model-predicted location. The data set begins in 1960; annual updates occur in September or October. The format of the IIP data has changed over the years. NSIDC has generated a merged data format that contains the common fields for the entire period of record. Both the IIP format data and the NSIDC merged format data are available. Data are in ASCII text files..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Monthly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Long-term Soil Environment Monitoring in the Rock Creek Watershed, Denali Park, Alaska. ABSTRACT: Purpose: The Rock Creek Watershed was chosen as an area to study ecological response to natural or cultural change over time. To study long-term ecological change, baseline data is necessary to determine existing conditions. The objectives of the proposed study are to verify (1) that each soil map unit has its unique soil environment parameters which are determined by relief and vegetation types. Based on the research results of the Bonanza Creek LTER project, soil temperatures are found to play a key role in vegetation community expression. (2) Soil formation is the combined effect of interaction among biota (mainly vegetation), parent (geological) material, relief and climate over time. In a given map unit, the parent material and relief remain as independent factors. The vegetation is the variable upon natural climate change or anthropogenic impact. Such change would be reflected in the soil parameters, ie. soil serves as feedback to the environment changes. Abstract: The research focus is on the soil environment monitoring in the Rock Creek Watershed. Soil properties are the result of interactions among atmosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere, thus soil properties are also sensitive to environmental changes over time. Soils function not only as water-nutrient life media but also as redistributors and regulators of most of the important fluxes of matter and energy. Therefore, soil environmental changes affect the immediate carrying capacity of the land, through their influence on the vegetation and land-use types, run-off, evaporation, groundwater quality. In recent years, the arctic tundra has been identified as the major source of global warming gas emission, i.e. CO2 and methane (Oechel et al. 1993), yet there is only limited research on the subarctic region. The environmental concerns within a few meters above or below the ground surface constitute the microclimate of a soil map unit or landscape unit and it is to these conditions that most soil organisms must adapt. The microclimate (soil environmental factors) is characterized by the radiation, temperature, and moisture regimes of the near-surface atmospheric and soil layers (Dingman et al., 1980). These regimes are determined by, and are also feedbacks to, regional and global climate, as modified by local topography and through the interaction with the biosphere. The soil and its environmental function in the ecosystem are important to the productivity and diversity of the terrestrial and aquatic biota. In addition, each soil has a self-contained biota, and is an efficient trap or collection system for many atmospheric contaminants. A careful description and a set of quantitative measurements of the soil are essential to estimating the sensitivity or stability of the ecosystem. A carefully designed monitoring system of the soil environment is essential to evaluate the effects of ecosystem changes caused by regional and global climate change, and the anthropogenic changes as well. Geographic Description: Rock Creek Watershed in the Denali National Park and Preserve, AK. Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central Alaska Range, approximately 210 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. Methodology: Select monitoring sites that cover the four major vegetation communities and ecotone as specified in the Objectives section. A soil inventory and soil characterization sampling were conducted with cooperation from the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Alaska State Office. Complete soil analysis were performed by NRCS - National Soil Survey Center according to national cooperative soil survey procedures and standards. The soil characterization data would serve as baseline data for soil parameters and also as reference to future changes in these parameters. Soil and soil environment parameters to be monitored: soil temperature, soil redox potential, soil water table and soil water potential, air temperature, instrumentation and monitoring - install micrometeorological stations which have sensors for monitoring air temperature, soil temperature, soil water matrix potential, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation. Soil temperature will be measured hourly at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm depths (100 cm for deep soils) with thermocouple; soil matrix water potential will be measured daily at 5, 10, 20, 50, and 75 cm with synthetic soil moisture blocks; relative humidity, wind, air temperature, and solar radiation will also be monitored hourly and recorded with datalogger. - Reduction-oxidation potential (redox) potential was measured with Jensen's platinum-electrode at 2.5, 10, 20, and 50 cm depth from the soil surface weekly and more frequently after rains, and recorded with Jensen's ORP meter with reference electrode..

TITLE: Ice Altimetry Data for Greenland and Antarctica from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. ABSTRACT: The Oceans and Ice Branch of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has processed satellite radar altimetry and aircraft laser altimetry over the continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica and surrounding sea ice to calculate surface elevations. The radar processing is currently being funded by the NASA Mission to Planet Earth Pathfinder Program. The data have been obtained from the Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, ERS-2 and GFO satellites radar altimeter missions and from the Arctic Ice Mapping (AIM) mission which utilizes NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeter. Radar Altimetry data from Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, ERS-2 and GFO satellites is available for distribution upon request. Data from ENVISAT will be available in the near future. The following data products are available: Level 1: Waveform Data Records Orbital format waveform data records at the full data rate which contain the time, location altimeter return waveform, and retracking parameters. The altimeter waveform return gives a measure of the surface roughness on scales of sub-meter to tens of kilometers and indicates if surface penetration and or volume scattering is present. These results are used to investigate regional, interdecadal and interannual changes in the ice sheet and sea ice surface characteristics. The returns are also used to identify sea ice boundaries and extent. Level 2: Ice Data Records Orbital format ice data records at the full data rate which contain the time, precise location, altimeter height measurement, corrected precise surface elevation, atmospheric corrections, tidal values, retracking corrections, and AGC. These data are updated on-line as more precise orbits, corrections, and tide values become available. These data are mainly used by scientists who are trying to improve the algorithms to calculate the corrections or who require knowledge of what effect the corrections have on the data. Most researchers do not require this much detail and would be better served by the georeference data bases which contain the precise surface height after all corrections have been applied at the full data rate. Level 3: Geo-referenced Database Contain surface height measurements derived from altimetry data, ordered by geographic areas or "bins". Each data record contains the geodetic position, revolution number, surface elevation relative to a reference ellipsoid, and slope correction. This database contains detailed elevation information for the full-rate along track data. Level 4: Elevation Grids Gridded elevations are calculated from the data by a weighted fitting of a bi-quadratic function (bi-linear where data distribution is poor) on a polar stereographic projection with a nominal spacing of 5 km (ERS-1) 10 km (GEOSAT) and 20 km (Seasat). The dense topographic coverage is crucial for a variety of glaciological studies, from numerical modeling of the ice dynamics to monitoring of key glaciological features: ice drainage basins, ice-shelf grounding lines, ice divides, subglacial lakes, ice shelf fronts, and ice rises. Crossover Data The crossover data give interpolated elevations for different tracks at the same location including the corrections also interpolated to the crossover location. These data are best used for ice sheet change studies. [This summary was adapted from the GSFC Ice Altimetry WWW pages.].

TITLE: Arctic Leads Experiment (LEADEX) Model Forcing and Data for the GEWEX Cloud System Study Data Integration for Model Evaluation (GCSS-DIME). ABSTRACT: Ships and submarines have historically used leads, or sea ice fractures, to navigate Arctic waters. Scientists study leads to better understand their roles in arctic climatology and global climate change. Leads, particularly those exposing warm ocean water to cold arctic air, influence the energy balance at polar latitudes by contributing to the atmospheric heat flux. Because the poles act as heat sinks in the global energy balance, lead formation, evolution and distribution in the polar regions is important. The objective of the Arctic Leads ARI was to gain a better understanding of lead dynamics. As part of the project, the Arctic Leads ARI Data Set was created to encourage the assembly of an arctic leads climatology. This case study presents data from 1 March 1992 to 30 April 1992 and covers a region from 65N to 80N latitude and from 180W to 120W longitude. The data for this experiment is under Working Group 5 (Polar Clouds) of the GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS) is to improve the parameterization of precipitating convective cloud systems in global climate models (GCMs) and numerical weather prediction models through an improved physical understanding of cloud system processes..

TITLE: Airborne X- and C-band SAR Images of Sea Ice in the Barents Sea. ABSTRACT: SIZEX-89 was an official pre-launch ERS-1 program where the main objectives were to perform ERS-1 type sensors signature studies of different ice types in order to develop SAR algorithms for ice variables such as ice types, ice concentrations and ice kinematics. SIZEX-89 was a multidisciplinary, international winter experiment carried out in the Barents and the Greenland Seas during February and March 1989. During the experiment, 130 CCT tapes of airborne X- and C-band SAR data were obtained by the CCRS CV-580 in the Barents Sea, in February 1989.

TITLE: Dielectric Profiling of Ice Cores. ABSTRACT: Dielectric profiles of a series of ice cores taken along the Norwegian-U.S. IPY traverse of East Antarctica, from Troll Station to the South Pole. The ice cores were drilled up to 90 meters deep. A DEP device is used to measure dielectic permittivity and electric conductivity along the length of the cores. Values are measured at intervals of 5 mm, thus enabling a high-resolution determination of electrical properties. Electrical properties are largely influenced by the total salt content as well as the acidity of the ice. In high accumulation areas annual-layer counting is possible, but in low accumulation areas a chronology based on comparison of DEP records with each other is required. Volcanic layers in Antarctica are well documented and have been used to date ice cores. In addition, DEP data are necessary for the calibration of shallow radar data and the conversion of two-way signal travel time to depth. Thus, our DEP measurements will aid in the interpretation of GPR data as well as in dating the ice cores. Sufficiently dated ice cores and radar layers are crucial for the determination of accumulation rates..

TITLE: ARM North Slope Alaska, Surface Meteorology. ABSTRACT: The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is the largest global change research program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and developing models to better understand the processes that control solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere (especially in clouds) and at the earth's surface. The URL for the ARM Data Archive is "http:  www.archive.arm.gov ". The URL for general information about the ARM program is "http:  www.arm.gov ". The data stored by the ARM Archive includes numerous parameters about radiative flux, meteorology, water vapor and clouds. The North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean (NSA AAO) site is providing data about cloud and radiative processes at high latitudes. These data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic. The NSA AAO site is centered at Barrow and extends to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (to Oliktok). Surface meteorology data at Barrow and Atqasuk are collected using many specialized instruments. Detailed information on each instrument is available at "http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The following list contains the instrumentation used for surface meteorology and the data available for the Barrow and Atqasuk sites. Barrow Meteorology Station (BMET). Surface meteorology at Barrow is obtained by using mainly conventional in situ sensors on the Barrow Meteorology station (BMET). For complete information on the BMET, see http:  www.arm.gov instruments . The BMET station directly measures wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and relative humidity at 2 m, 10 m, 20 m, and 40 m. Vector-averaged wind speeds, vector-averaged wind directions, dew points, and vapor pressures are computed from these primary measurements. Periodically, 2 m air and dew point temperatures are measured using a chilled-mirror hygrometer. Barometric pressure, visibility, and precipitation at the surface are also directly measured. Meterological data at Barrow are available from 1998-03-20 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsacmhC1: chilled mirror humidity nsamettwrC1: surface meteorological measurements and statistics at four tower levels nsaorgC1: optical rain gauge measurements: precipitation rate and accumulation nsapwsC1: present weather sensor measurements of visibility and precipitation. Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future. Surface Meterological Station (SMET). Surface meteorology at Atqasuk is obtained by using a 10-m tower and nearby SMET. For complete information on the SMET, see "http:  www.arm.gov instruments ". The SMET stations directly measure: (1) wind speed at 10 m, (2) wind direction at 10 m, (3) air temperature at 2 m, (4) relative humidity at 2 m, (5) barometric pressure at 1 m, and (6) precipitation. Meterological data at Atqasuk are available from 2001-03-31 to present. ARM data streams are coded as follows: nsacmhC2: chilled mirror humidity nsamettiptwrC2: surface meteorological data at 6-m and 2-m heights nsapwsC2: present weather sensor measurements of visibility and precipitation nsasnodepC2: snow depth Additional data streams or value added products may be added in the future..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Monthly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 3 Hourly 0.25 x 0.25 degree Subsetted V001 (GLDAS_NOAH025SUBP_3H) at GES DISC. ABSTRACT: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah 2.7.1 model in the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The data are in 0.25 degree resolution and range from 2000 to the present. The temporal resolution is 3-hour. This simulation was forced by combination of NOAA GDAS atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency&#039;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET). The simulation was initialized on 1 January 1979 using soil moisture and other state fields from a GLDAS Noah model climatology for that day of the year. WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number.

TITLE: SCICEX Hydrographic Data, 1997 and 1998. ABSTRACT: The Scientific Ice Expeditions (SCICEX) Program was a series of five multidisciplinary scientific cruises that utilized US Navy operational submarines as platforms for sampling the Arctic Ocean. The program's numerous principal investigators worked towards the overarching goal of characterizing the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean as completely as possible. This data set includes hydrographic data obtained during the 1997 and 1998 (third and fourth) SCICEX cruises, aboard the USS Archerfish and the USS Hawkbill, respectively. Water column profile data were collected using a submarine-launched conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probe. Probe depths were computed based on a known fall rate, temperature (T) and conductivity values were measured by probe sensors, and salinity was computed from these values. Derived variables, including pressure (calculated from depth and latitude), potential temperature, sigma-t (a representation of density), and sigma-theta (sigma-t calculated with potential temperature), are also included. Profile data were generally collected to a depth of 1000 m at 1-m depth intervals, with variable horizontal distance between the profiles. Data were collected between September 3 and October 2, 1997, and between August 1 and September 2, 1998, along extensive transects within the Arctic Ocean..

TITLE: Global Land Use Data Sets. ABSTRACT: Information on soils, vegetation types, cultivated areas, wetlands and inundated areal fraction at 1- x 1-degree resolution for the Earth are available. Global FAO soil units data distinguish 27 soil types. The vegetation data set gives the global distribution of 32 vegetation types based on the UNESCO classification system. The cultivation data set describes the global distribution of cultivation intensity, distinguishing 5 classes. The wetlands data set gives the global distribution of wetlands, distinguishing 5 classes. These 5 wetlands classes were collapsed from 12 original classes that defined worldwide wetland ecosystems on the basis of environmental characteristics governing methane emissions. The inundated areal fraction data set is the global distribution of inundated areal fraction of 1-degree cells. These data can be combined with the wetlands data to calculate global wetland area..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 2 Local Area Coverage (LAC) Geophysical Ocean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  Each Level-2 Local Area Coverage (LAC) product is generated from a corresponding Level-1B product. The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel, derived from the Level-1B radiances by applying the atmospheric corrections, and SST retrieval algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1B product and is stored in one physical HDF file. The resolution is the same as the corresponding level 1B file (1 km). The standard SST product contains: SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime and nighttime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) In addition, 32 flags are associated with each pixel indicating if any algorithm failures or warning conditions occurred for that pixel. Detailed information on the Level-2 format specifications can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-2_Data_Products.pdf Level-2 processing is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSl12) code, which is developed and maintained by the OBPG. The algorithms and logic were originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  . Full documentation, updated code source, sensor files, and output product descriptions can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MSL12 . For MODIS, the Level-1B file and the GEO file for each 5-minute granule are input to MSl12. The Level-2 processing also makes use of reference SST information from ancillary sources. In the near real-time (NRT) stream, the previous weekâs Reynolds SST data are used. The NRT Quick Look products are then immediately available on the web browser and in the rolling FTP archive within 6-10 hours of observation. When the definitive attitude and orbit and coincident Reynolds SST data are received several days later, they are used in the Refined-processing stream and the Level-2 products are regenerated.

TITLE: Brightness Temperature images processed and delivered in near-real time from the AVHRR and ATSR instruments at Tromso Satellite Station. ABSTRACT: Under an ESA contract TSS receives global ATSR data from the ERS-1 satellite. This is a demonstration project where data is processed in Tromso and the products are distributed directly to the end user. The UK Met. Office is one of the users having received ATSR data products from TSS. This near real-time service is set up using Internet for transmission of the products. The operational service aquires an average of 10 ERS-1 passes a day, every day throughout the year. Through this near real-time demonstration project, the TSS infrastructure has proven to be very well suited for supporting an operational service with useful and necessary information. A full resolution ATSR data product chain has also been implemented very recently. TSS can now offer in near-real time full resolution (1 km) brightness and sea surface temperature products. The coverage is global for the ATSR, and for the AVHRR the coverage is that of TSS (i.e. Europe)..

TITLE: Bathymetry of the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The goal of this project is to develop a digital database that contains all available bathymetric data north of 64 degrees North, for use by mapmakers, researchers, and others whose work requires a detailed and accurate knowledge of the depth and the shape of the Arctic seafloor.Initiated in 1997, this undertaking has so far engaged the volunteer efforts of investigators who are affiliated with eleven institutions in eight countries: Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA. The activity has also been endorsed and or supported financially by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the US Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the US National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).Version 1.0 of the IBCAO Grid is available for dowloading, along with bathymetric contours in digital vector form and an updated version of the Map that is suitable for plotting. We'd appreciate feedback on how to improve these products, along with information that would help us obtain new data sets for enhancing the IBCAO database.The information used in the construction of this database and map consist of: historic and recent under-ice soundings collected by submarines of the United States and the United Kingdom; historic and recent observations collected by icebreakers and drifting ice stations; and information portrayed in published navigation and compilation charts. The locations of these data sets are shown in separate source distribution maps, while data contributors and relevant references are listed in this legend under "Data Contributions".Although extensive, in some areas the database of digital trackline and spot observations contained critical gaps that had to be augmented with information that was only available on paper maps and charts. In the central Arctic Ocean, original observations were augmented with contour information derived from a map published by the Russian Federation Navy. Similarly, contours extracted from maps published by the Geological Society of America were used in Bering Strait and in the Barents and Kara Seas. On the continental shelf adjacent to Siberia, soundings were extracted from a suite of navigational charts published by the Russian Federation Navy, and used to develop contours. Bathymetry in the Gulf of Bothnia was derived from a compilation by Seifert and Kayser. Contours were extracted from the GEBCO Digital Atlas (GDA) to supplement the database in the southern Norwegian-Greenland Seas, in Baffin Bay, and in some areas of the Canadian Arctic.Land relief was derived from the USGS GTOPO30 topographic model, with the exception of Greenland, where the model developed by the Danish National Survey and Cadastre (KMS) was used, and Alaska, where release 1.1 of the GLOBE topographic model was used Coastline definition was provided by the World Vector Shoreline (WVS) in all areas except Greenland and northern Ellesmere Island, where an updated coastline was available from KMS.Original soundings were corrected for sound velocity using Carter's Tables, or CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth) profiles where available. Subsequently, all data (digitized isobaths; land and marine relief grids; point, profile and swath observations; and vector shorelines) were imported into Intergraph's Geomedia Professional, with projection parameters set to polar stereographic on the WGS 84 ellipsoid, and with true scale at 75i?? N. Outliers, cross-track errors, and the fit between isobaths and original observation data were checked. Suspicious soundings were removed and, where contours showed major discrepancies with soundings, the contours were adjusted manually to agree with trackline data.After inspection all data sets were exported to an XYZ coordinate system for further manipulation with GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) public domain software. Initially, the data sets were preprocessed with the GMT block-median filter, after which they were gridded at a cell size of 2.5 x 2.5 km by fitting a surface of continuous curvature to all points with a tension parameter set to 0.35. The resulting grid was exported to Intergraph's MGE Terrain Analyst (MTA) for detailed inspection, and for the identification of discrepancies that had to be addressed in the input data set. The data were then regridded and reinspected for residual discrepancies. This process was repeated until the results were judged to be satisfactory.The grid that was used for the construction of the map can be obtained in two forms: Cartesian with a cell size of 2.5 x 2.5 km at 75i??N, and Geographic with a cell size of one minute of latitude by one minute of longitude. These grids, along with detailed descriptions of their formats and the techniques employed in their preparation, can be downloaded. PURPOSE: Scientific Data CURRENTNESS REFERENCE: Publication Date.

TITLE: Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) Project Data at UCAR JOSS NOAA CODIAC. ABSTRACT: The Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) was initiated to gather research data in the Arctic in order to improve how Global Climate Models (GCMs) simulate the present and future effects of global change in this region. Between January 1997 and November 1998 the multi-national science team carried out the three components of this project. The first component was a field project staged from a 13-month drifting sea ice camp in the Arctic Ocean. The other components included the gathering of satellite remotely sensed data and modelling data. http:  data.eol.ucar.edu codiac projs?SHEBA.

TITLE: A Half-Century of Change in Arctic Alaskan Shrubs: A Photographic-Based Assessment. ABSTRACT: In this study, the locations of 193 old aerial photographs of northern Alaskan landscapes were rephotographed and assessed for changes in vegetation. The original photographs were taken over northern Alaska between 1948 and 1951, and the new photographs were taken between 1999 and 2003. The region covered by the original and repeat photographs stretches from the southern extent of the Brooks Range in the south to the Coastal Plain in the north, and from the Chukchi Sea in the west to the Canning River in the east. Approximate coordinates are 68&deg;N to 70&deg;N and 145&deg;W to 165&deg;W. The original photographs were taken by the U.S. military as part of geologic reconnaissance and exploration, and the method used to acquire them was to fly both sides of a river valley while photographing the river and the facing valley slopes. Of the several thousand original photographs, only a fraction were repeated for the purpose of assessing vegetation change. Repeat photographs were selected for geographic coverage and to produce the greatest likelihood of detecting vegetation change. The original and repeat photographs were then scanned and stored in TIFF format. Individual image file sizes range from 5 to 60 MB each, and the total file size for the data set is 11 GB. The photographs are distributed on a set of three DVDs. The images should not be published without the consent of the investigators..

TITLE: Digital Geotechnical Database for the Mackenzie Valley Delta Region. ABSTRACT: The Mackenzie Valley Geotechnical Database is a compilation of existing geological and geotechnical data for over 12,000 boreholes that extend from the arctic coast to northwestern Alberta. Additional information on site conditions such as terrain disturbance, vegetation and geomorphology are also included. The original database, compiled in the early 1970s by Proudfoot and Lawrence (1976), contained over 11,000 boreholes. Most of these data were obtained from pipeline and highway related field drilling programs conducted between 1970 and 1975. In the early 1990s approximately 1400 boreholes were added to the database. These data included some of the site investigations undertaken for the construction of the Norman Wells Pipeline Project and the Mackenzie Highway. The Geological Survey of Canada has compiled data for all boreholes into a searchable GIS compatible relational database in Microsoft Access format..

TITLE: Baltic Seabirds Transect Surveys. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Seabirds transect surveys were conducted in Baltic Sea from 1992 to 1999. PURPOSE: The main purpose of our work was to investigate spatial structure and dynamics of the offshore seabird populations and to assess their status in specific conditions of the Baltic Sea marine ecosystem. The main tasks of our work were the following: ---Study species composition, abundance and spatial distribution of seabird populations in different seasons of the year, distinguish dominating species and the most important seabird concentration areas in the eastern Baltic; ---Study community structure of inter-specific assemblages and ecological adaptations of wintering seabird populations; ---Study the processes of spatial dynamics and trends of spatial structure in regional seabird populations within the gradient of winter climatic conditions; ---Study offshore migratory routes and temporary concentration areas of seabirds in the Baltic Proper. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Standard seabird offshore sampling techniques (Tasker et al., 1984; Webb, Durinck, 1992) assume that line transect of 300 m width is basically used for counting birds sitting on the water surface, whereas snap-shot method is used for counting of flying birds at strongly fixed intervals of time. Additional efforts were put into studies of the offshore seabird and waterfowl movements. We recorded flying birds along 1000 m wide transect over the \"classic\" 300 m transect used for calculations of seabird densities during \"snap-shots\".

MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Weekly Plots of Node B CTD Data Weekly Plots of Node B CTD Data. ABSTRACT: The LEO-15 Nodes are the center of our underwater research and are located 3 (Node A) and 4.5 (Node B) miles off the New Jersey coast near Tuckerton. The nodes record data on water temperatures, salinity, clarity, wave height, current speeds etc. Weekly Plots of Node B CTD and Wave Data: LEO-15 Node-B Real-Time Wave Analysis is available online. Surface waves at LEO-15 are measured with a bottom-mounted pressure sensor, not a surface buoy. By the time they reach the seafloor, shorter period waves have been attenuated more than longer period waves. Waves with periods below about 4.5 seconds are rarely observable with the LEO-15 bottom-mounted pressure sensor. Surface buoy observations include waves with periods below 4.5 seconds, so they report higher significant wave heights than the LEO-15 pressure sensor. The Data from LEO-15 research is made available to the public on the condition that Rutgers, its employees and agents make no representations or warranties regarding the reliability or validity of the data nor the use to which such data should be put, disclaim any and all responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies in the data and bear no responsibility for any use made of this data by any party..

TITLE: Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-Ice Conditions. ABSTRACT: The Circum-Arctic permafrost and ground ice map is available via ftp in ESRI Shapefile format and Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) format. See the Format section for an explanation of the files provided via ftp. The circumpolar permafrost and ground ice data contribute to a unified international data set that depicts the distribution and properties of permafrost and ground ice in the Northern Hemisphere (20°N to 90°N). The re-gridded data set shows discontinuous, sporadic, or isolated permafrost boundaries. Permafrost extent is estimated in percent area (90-100%, 50-90%, 10-50%, <10%, and no permafrost). Relative abundance of ground ice in the upper 20 m is estimated in percent volume (>20%, 10-20%, <10%, and 0%). The data set also contains the location of subsea and relict permafrost. the gridded data are gridded at 12.5 km, 25 km, and 0.5 degree resolution. The shapefiles were derived from the original 1:10,000,000 paper map (Brown et al. 1997) Permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, is ground (soil, sediment, or rock) that remains at or below 0°C for at least two years (Permafrost Subcommittee, 1988). It occurs both on land and beneath offshore arctic continental shelves, and underlies about 22% of the Earth's land surface. For more information on the creation of the original map, see Heginbottom et al. (1993). The original paper map also includes information on the relative abundance of ice wedges, massive ice bodies and Pingos, ranges of permafrost temperature and thickness (Brown et al. 1997)..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Weekly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: Compiled Shorebird Migration Locations for Great Knot, Red Knot and Bar-Tailed Godwit in the Sea of Okhotsk coastal region, Russian Far East. ABSTRACT: Movements of animals are believed to improve their fitness. Migration is such a technique, and it can be commonly observed among birds. In most of the migratory species, clear migration patterns and seasonal migration routes can be found. The migration strategies of shorebirds are manifold, and with some exceptions still not fully explained. The Pacific East Asian-Australasian Flyway is among the least investigated migration routes for shorebirds; it presents one of the longest flyways in the world and is a major link between birds in the wintering ground of the southern hemisphere (mostly Australia and New Zealand) and the breeding grounds of the northern hemisphere (mostly the Russian high arctic). The Russian Far Eastern part of this flyway has received relatively little international attention; this is mostly due to restricted access until 1989, and lack of awareness and financial support after 1989. Nevertheless, proximity to breeding grounds, huge mudflats, high tides and numerous river estuaries suggest that this region should be of importance to shorebirds on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. This has triggered the research and data compilation for this project. In order to learn more about this flyway, three focal species (Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris, Red Knot Calidris canutus, and Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica) were selected as they are considered to be long-distance migrants restricted to a limited number of key staging areas along the threatened coastlines of this flyway. 232 known locations and their basic habitat descriptors (e.g. Tidal range, freshwater inflow yes no, estuary area, surrounding habitat type) from GIS (Geographic Information Systems) overlays are presented for these 3 species from compiled references and literature reviews for the migration strategies relevant to the focal species in the coastal Sea of Okhotsk region and the context of the East Asian Australasian flyway. These compiled data are taken from Huettmann 2003, which constitutes the final part of a research contract with Doug Watkins for Wetlands International, Environment Australia (see Huettmann 2000 for part I). No specific field guide exists for the birds of Russian Far East (but see see Flint et al. 1984 and Knystautas 1987 for general ornithological information; and for shorebirds Johnsgard 1981 and Hayman et al. 1986). Other than perhaps Gill et al. (1994) no English publications are available that cover the whole species spectrum of birds to be encountered during migration season (compare Paulson 1993 and Truett and Johnson 2000). Despite a shift of paradigms in recent years, most publications on shorebird migration are in Russian still, and not available to the general international public. Here we try to fill this gap providing GIS data sets for this habitat and for the three shorebird species..

TITLE: Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) Data Products from the Institute of Environmental Physics and Remote Sensing (IUP ife), Germany. ABSTRACT: In collaboration with the DLR German Remote Sensing Data Center (DLR DFD), and the European Space Agency (ESA), the Bremen Institute of Environmental Physics and Remote Sensing (ife iup) provided near real-time GOME ozone maps during the arctic winter 1997 (January 24, 1997 - March 31, 1997). The delivery of near-real-time total ozone maps and vertical profiles by ife iup supported the coordination of aircraft and balloon experiments as part of the European arctic winter campaign in and around Kiruna, Sweden (POLSTAR, POLECAT, ADEOS-Validation). The investigation of the GOME vertical profile distribution in the northern hemisphere in connection with the dynamics of the polar vortex and ozone loss during winter spring 1997 is one major goal in the campaign activities. Preliminary height-resolved ozone and total column ozone images are presented. Near-real-time height-resolved ozone maps are only available for the time of the arctic campaign until March 31, 1997. Since the support of NRT GOME Level-2 data (total ozone) has been continued, total ozone maps from the same day are still provided on this web site. The 1-day total ozone images are updated every six hours. The ozone maps are produced at ife iup using the Level-2 data (total columns of ozone) provided from the new Kiruna-based GDP (GOME Data Processor) of the DLR DFD. The ESA station in Kiruna is one of five ground stations receiving the global ERS-2 transmission. Ten out of the daily fourteen GOME orbits are transmitted to Kiruna. In the near future three additional orbits from the Mapolamos and Gatineau stations will be also available. The ozone vertical profiles are generated at the University of Bremen using the GDP Level-1 data (radiometrically calibrated sun and earthshine spectra). GOME Global Ozone Distributions ------------------------------- With the current scan strategy (960-km swath) it takes GOME three days to achieve global coverage (for details see the GOME instrument description). For each month (beginning with July 1996) the plots on this page show four three-day periods of GOME measured total ozone values as indicated in the plot titles. This gives an impression of the evolution of the global ozone distribution during one month. Vertical column amounts of ozone are operationally derived from the GOME spectra at DLR-DFD using the DOAS method. At ife iup the irregularly spaced measurement points are gridded to a regular lat-long grid before being mapped. White space on the maps is due to data gaps.

TITLE: The NOAA Climate Monitoring Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) Aerosol Data from the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center via WWW. ABSTRACT: The NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) address on the WWW is 'http:  www.cmdl.noaa.gov '. This data set records light-scattering coefficient and condensation nuclei concentration measurements, taken from four monitoring stations at remote locations. The data are collected by the Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change (GMCC) Program to measure the concentrations and characteristics of gaseous and aerosol species in the atmosphere. The mission of the GMCC program is to detect any long-term trends in the concentrations of these species caused by anthropogenic or natural sources, and to assess possible climatic effects that may result from these changes. The four monitoring stations are located at 1) Barrow, Alaska; 2) Mauna Loa, Hawaii; 3) Cape Matatula, American Samoa; and 4) Amundsen-Scott Station, South Pole, Antarctica. All are located on approximately the same longitude and are situated to allow sampling of Arctic, northern midtropical, southern midtropical, and Antarctic air. The stations are located at remote sites to minimize the effect of local pollution sources. At each station, a condensation nucleus counter measures the condensation nuclei concentration, and nephelometers measure the scattering portion of extinction due to aerosol particles in the atmosphere at four wavelengths, 450, 550, 700, and 850 nm. The output signal of each instrument is sampled once per second, and data are stored on magnetic tape in the form of 1-min and 1-hour means. The data are then edited on an hourly basis to eliminate bad data, fill missing data from backup instruments, and apply final calibrations. A nearly continuous record is available from the Barrow station since 1971, from Mauna Loa since 1974, from Samoa since 1977, and from the South Pole since 1974. All GMCC aerosol data are available from the principal investigator in magnetic tape, printout, graphic, or microfiche format..

TITLE: Organic Fe Speciation in the Southern Ocean. ABSTRACT: Objectives The distribution and biological availability of Fe is strongly controlled by its physical-chemical speciation within seawater, where colloids and Fe-organic complexes are dominant factors. In order to study the distribution and the biological availability of Fe, the natural Fe organic complexes over the whole water depth were determined in three different size fractions. Special attention was given in that distinct water masses present were sampled as well. Samples were collected by an ultra-clean sampling system using 24 Go Flo bottles fixed on an all-titanium frame and with a Kevlar cable. The concentration of iron binding ligands (organic compounds which strongly bind Fe) and their binding strength (conditional stability constant) are studied in 3 size classes here: unfiltered water, 0.2 µm filtered water and smaller than 1000 KDa ultra-filtrated water. Methods General Under ultra clean conditions the 0.2 µm filtered seawater was ultra-filtrated using polyethylene hollow-fiber filters as to make an operational defined distinction between large colloidal and small colloidal Fe including the “truly dissolved” Fe (1000 KDa nominal weight, Stereapore, Mitsubishi-rayon Co. Ltd, Nishioka and al., 2000, 2005). The dissolved organic iron (0.2 µm filtered) as well as the truly dissolved iron (< 1000 KDa) were analysed by Maarten Klunder and Patrick Laan using a chemo luminescence method (FIA) with acidified samples (pH 1.8). Total iron will be measured 6-12 months after the acidification of the unfiltered sample. The natural ligand characteristics were determined by doing a complexing ligand titration with addition of iron (between 0 and 8 nM of Fe added) in buffered seawater (mixed NH3 NH4OH borate buffer, 5 mM). The competing ligand ‘TAC’ (2-(2-Thiazolylazo)-p-cresol) with a final concentration of 10 µM was used and the complex (TAC)2-Fe was measured after equilibration (> 15 h) by cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) (Croot and Johansson, 2000). The electrical signal recorded with this method (nA) was converted as a concentration (nM), then the ligand concentration and the binding strength were estimated using the non-linear regression of the Langmuir isotherm (Gerringa and al., 1995). The voltammetric equipment consisted of a µAutolab potentiostat (Type I, II and III, Ecochemie, The Netherlands), a mercury drop electrode (model VA 663 from Metrohm). All equipment was protected against electrical noise by a current filter (Fortress 750, Best Power). Sampling statistics Seven stations were sampled on the zero meridian transect with a maximal depth of 4500 m. A total of 140 samples on 56 depths were sampled (28 of unfiltered, 56 of 0.2 µm filtered and 56 of 1000 KDa ultra-filtered). Among them, 11 depths characterizing the most important water-masses were sampled twice and kept frozen for later analyses while back at NIOZ (for the study of kinetic exchange between the different forms of iron). Two profiles were sampled in the Weddell Sea for a total of 46 samples (8 of unfiltered, 19 of 0.2 µm filtered and 19 of 1000 KDa ultra-filtered). 8 depths were also sampled twice to characterize important water-masses..

TITLE: MODIS Terra Clouds 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and 5km (Collection 004 and 005). ABSTRACT: MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands), and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at NASA Goddard DAAC and has been made available to public since April 2000. The level-2 MODIS cloud product consists of cloud optical and physical parameters. These parameters are derived using remotely sensed infrared, visible and near infrared solar reflected radiances. MODIS infrared channel radiances are used to derive cloud top temperature, cloud top height, effective emissivity, cloud phase (ice vs. water, opaque vs. non-opaque), and cloud fraction under both daytime and nighttime conditions. MODIS visible radiances are used to derive cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius and cloud shadow effects. Near infrared solar reflected radiance provides additional information in the retrieval of cloud particle phase (ice vs. water, clouds vs. snow). The shortname for this level-2 MODIS cloud product is MOD06_L2 and the principal investigators for this product are MODIS scientists Dr. Bo-Cai Gao ( gao@rsd.nrl.navy.mil) for cirrus cloud detection; Dr. Paul Menzel ( paulm@ssec.wisc.edu) for cloud top properties; and Dr. Michael King( king@climate.gsfc.nasa.gov) for cloud optical properties . The level-2 cloud product (MOD06_L2) consists of 46 gridded cloud parameters. These parameters are produced at a spatial resolution of either 1- km or 5-km (at nadir). Each MOD06_L2 product file covers a five-minute time interval. This means that for 5-km resolution parameters, the output grid is 270 pixels in width by 406 pixels in length. Every tenth granule has an output grid size of 270 by 408 pixels. For 1-km resolution parameters, the output grid is 1354 pixels in width by 2030 pixels in length and every tenth granule has an output grid size of 1354 by 2040 pixels. MOD06_L2 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Forty four of the 46 gridded cloud parameters are stored as Scientific Data Sets (SDS) within the file, the remaining two (band number and statistics) are stored as Vdata(table arrays). Approximately 288 files are produced daily. Nighttime files are smaller than their daytime counterparts since only cloud top properties are retrieved at night. Each daytime file is roughly 65.1 MB in size and each nighttime HDF file roughly 12.4 MB in size, and the total data volume is approximately 12.3 GB day. MOD06_L2 Data Category & Parameters Spatial & Temporal Resolution: latitude,longitude scan start time Solar and Sensor Viewing Geometry: solar zenith angle, solar azimuth angle sensor zenith angle, sensor azimuth angle Cloud Top Parameters (5km): cloud top pressure from IR retriev(daytime,nighttime,all) cloud top pressures from individual thermal band ratios cloud height retrieval method, tropopause height surface pressure cloud top temperature (daytime,nighttime,all) cloud effective emissivity (daytime,nighttime,all) cloud fraction (daytime,nighttime,all) cloud phase(daytime, nighttime, all) Cloud Optical Properties (1km): cloud optical thickness cloud water path effective particle radius effective particle radius difference Radiation Parameters: spectral cloud forcing cirrus reflectance surface type (emissivity based) Brightness Temperature Brightness Temperature Difference Quality Assurance Parameters: Processing flag for 5 km resolution cirrus reflectance flag for 1 km resolution quality assurance flag for 1 & 5 km resolution cloud mask for 1 & 5 km, radiance variance for thermal bands statistics for parameters at 1km resolution The MODIS Cloud Product will be used to investigate seasonal and inter-annual changes in cirrus (semi-transparent) global cloud cover and cloud phase with multispectral observations at high spatial (1 kilometer) resolution.

TITLE: The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement II (SAM II) Data set (SAM2_AERO_PRF_NAT). ABSTRACT: The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) II experiment flew aboard the Nimbus 7 spacecraft and provided vertical profiles of aerosol extinction in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions. The SAM II data coverage began on October 29, 1978 and extended through December 18, 1993, until SAM II was no longer able to acquire the sun. The data coverage for the Antarctic region extends through December 18, 1993, and has one data gap for the period of time from mid-January through the end of October 1993. The data coverage for the Arctic region extends through January 7, 1991, and contains data gaps beginning in 1988 that increase in size each year due to an orbit degradation associated with the Nimbus-7 spacecraft..

TITLE: Soil climate and atmospheric data for Scott Base, Marble Point, Mount Fleming, Bull Pass, Granite Harbour, Minna Bluff and the Victoria Valley, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: In collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) climate stations were installed at six locations in the Ross Sea Region including Scott Base, Marble Point and Bull Pass all in the summer of 1998-1999, Mount Fleming in 2001-2002, Granite Harbour in 2002-2003 and Minna Bluff in 2002-2003. These stations make continuous atmospheric and soil climate recordings to provide information for comparison of soil climatic attributes with those from Arctic regions, to help understand the impacts of global climate changes on cold region soils and permafrost. New Zealand took over the annual maintenance and data collection from climate stations in the Victoria Valley in the 2001-2002. Each station monitors soil moisture, soil temperature and salinity to depths of 1.2 m. Measurements of atmospheric variables include air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed and direction. MRC temperature probes were installed at depths of 2 cm to 1.2 m at Minna Bluff and Granite Harbour (2002-2003). Measurements are made at 20 minute intervals and averaged and recorded every hour..

TITLE: Dataset for COPOL project. ABSTRACT: COPOL is a project under the auspices of the International Polar Year (IPY). The main objective of the project is to understand the dynamic range of man-made contaminants in marine ecosystems of Polar Regions, in order to better predict how possible future climate change will be reflected in levels and effects at higher trophic levels. This aim will be addressed by 4 integrated work packages covering the scopes of 1) food web contaminant exposure and flux, 2) transfer to higher trophic levels and potential effects, 3) chemical analyses and screening, 4) synthesis and integration. The COPOL project focuses on the Arctic region, and the main effort is concentrated in Kongsfjorden (Spitzbergen). This fjord has been identified as particularly suitable as a study site of contaminants processes, due to the remoteness of sources, and for influences of climatic changes, due to the documented relation between Atlantic water influx and the climatic index North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Variable Atlantic water influx will not only influence abiotic contaminant exposure, but also food web structure, food quality and energy pathways, as different water masses carry different phyto- and zooplankton assemblages. This may affect the flux of contaminants through the food web to high trophic level predators such as seabirds and seals, due to altered food quality and energy pathways. Three field campaigns were conducted in 2007 (spring, summer and autumn), 2008 (summer), 2009 (summer) collecting sea water, sediments, and organisms ranging from plankton and benthic invertebrates, to fish and sea birds. In 2007 two stations in Kongsfjorden was sampled, in 2008 and 2009 same stations in Kongsfjorden was sampled and one station in Liefdefjorden. At all stations the same type of samples were collected..

TITLE: Ptarmigan Dropsondes (Arctic reconnaissance) for 1950-1961. ABSTRACT: Dropsonde observations were made by the U.S. Air Force along the "Ptarmigan" track of its reconaissance program. This track was mainly over the Beaufort Sea and the western Arctic Ocean. Vertical profiles of geopotential height, temperature, and dewpoint temperature at various pressure levels are available for eleven years between 1950 and 1961 (excluding 1953) for the lower troposphere mainly below 500mb. In comparing the locations on the dropsondes to the locations on the aircraft reconaissance reports in ds360.0 [], DSS found that the dropsonde longitudes are off by 10 degrees. For dropsondes over the Western Hemisphere, the positions are 10 degrees east of the aircraft positions, and for the Eastern Hemisphere, they are 10 degrees west of the aircraft position..

TITLE: Air Temperature and Thaw Depth, North Slope, Alaska: Field Measurements (1995-97) and Computed Values. ABSTRACT: This data product contains field data measurements of air temperatures and thaw depth (active-layer thickness) measured at locations in north-central Alaska, and modelled values of air temperatures and thaw depth extrapolated to an area encompassing the Kuparuk River basin of north-central Alaska. Air temperature and thaw depth were measured in the years 1995, 1996, and 1997; air temperature was measured at 10 core Flux Study plots and additional sites, and thaw depth was measured within each of seven ARCSS 1 km x 1 km grids. The data were collected to provide a basis for extrapolating thawing degree-days and thaw depth to the landscape scale (the Kuparuk River basin). Modelled air temperatures derived from the 1995 air temperature measurements are represented in 787 x 371 element matrices of thawing degree-day sums at weekly intervals for part of summer 1995. Thaw depth matrices were modelled using the interpolated thawing degree-day data, a vegetation map of the Kuparuk River basin, and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the same area. Modelled thaw depth is represented in 178 x 369 element matrices of active-layer thickness at weekly intervals for part of summer 1995, one time period in 1996, and 'end-of-season' (August 6) 1997..

TITLE: Level 3.0 6-hourly gridded VAM analyses of ocean surface wind velocity (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov PRODUCTS p079.html ). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com  ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao  ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used ( http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata  ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR ( http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets  ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. The Level 3.0 data contains 6-hourly gridded VAM instantaneous analyses, centered at 0, 6, 12 and 18Z.

TITLE: Globorotalia truncatulinoides (R) Mg Ca Water Temperature Calibration. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of Globorotalia truncatulinoides (R) Mg Ca to water temperature calibrations from Indian Ocean core-top sediments and plankton tows. G. truncatulinoides (R) is a deep dwelling species that provides a Mg thermometer for the extremes of the permanent thermocline. Abstract Recent work has provided useful Mg Ca to water temperature calibrations for shallow-dwelling planktonic foraminifer species. Globorotalia truncatulinoides (right coiling (R)) is a deep-dwelling species that can serve as a source of information about the temporal variability in the water characteristics of the thermocline. We present a temperature calibration for the Mg Ca in the shell of G. truncatulinoides (R) and examine some of the practical issues associated with evaluating the usefulness of the technique. The Mg Ca in the primary and the secondary calcite of individual G. truncatulinoides (R) correlates exponentially with water column temperatures, showing a change of ~10% in the Mg Ca per 1°C (R2 = 0.92). A limited comparison with plankton tow samples demonstrates that the average Mg Ca temperature was offset +1°C from the average temperature calculated using the D18O calibration of O'Neil et al. [1969], and the Mg Ca temperatures have a range similar to the d18O temperatures. Comparisons of the [Mg] in the core top samples to water depth of deposition indicates that dissolution does not alter the measured value of Mg in the primary calcite..

TITLE: Seismograph data from the David Glacier region near Terra Nova Bay to determine the origins of low magnitude seismicity in the area: brittle ice failure, basal shearing beneath the glacier, or tectonic events?. ABSTRACT: Temporary seismograph stations placed in the Transantarctic Mountains have recorded regular, low magnitude seismicity. The origin of the quakes could not be uniquely discriminated among brittle ice failure, basal shearing beneath the glacier or tectonic events. A targeted passive seismic array was placed in the David Glacier region to directly investigate the seismicity of the region by distinguishing the nature of the seismic events and to enable discrimination and separation of events that are associated with surface crevassing or glacial basal shear rather than tectonics. A temporary array of 9 broadband seismograph stations were deployed between the coastline and about 100 km inland with about 30-40 km station spacing using available outcrops. The seismograph array was deployed at the beginning of November 2003 and retrieved at the end of January 2004..

TITLE: The World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). ABSTRACT: The Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) aimed at detecting important changes in the earth's radiation field which may cause climate changes. At a small number of stations (fewer than 40) in contrasting climatic zones, covering a latitude range from 800N to 900S (see station maps), solar and atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available accuracy and at a very high frequency (minutes). The radiation data are stored together with collocated surface and upper-air observations and station `metadata' in an integrated database at the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC). High accuracy BSRN radiation measurements are already used to validate the radiation schemes in climate models and to calibrate satellite algorithms. For questions, comments or remarks please contact the WRMC data manager at bsrnadm@geo.umnw.ethz.ch (mailtool at bottom of left frame). For questions concerning the quality of data please contact the WRMC quality manager at muller@geo.umnw.ethz.ch. [Summary extracted from the BSRN Homepage].

TITLE: Topographical and geological surveys and biology and soil sampling of the area between the Pennell and Tucker Glaciers to the Oates Land coast in north Victoria Land. ABSTRACT: An area roughly bounded by the Matusevich Glacier (157°, 30'E) in the west to the Tucker Glacier in the east and from 72° S north to the Oates Land coast was examined in reconnaissance fashion, including geological mapping and triangulation surveys. The southern limits mapped extended to the northern edge of the regions mapped in the 1962-63 season parties. Continuity of the geology was achieved between the western boundary of the Hallett geological map and the most eastern point, north of the Tucker Glacier. A total of 510 geological specimens were taken from 145 examined localities and used for age determination and bulk chemical analysis. The areas examined geologically include the Pennell Glacier to Arctic Institute Range, Central Rennick Glacier area, the east side of the Rennick Glacier to Lillie Glacier and from the Lillie Glacier to Tucker Glacier. More than 30 determinations of gravity were made during the course of the operation. 50 specimens of lichen, 14 soil and 10 moss samples were collected with precise positions located with reference to survey points. Biological observations while undertaking survey work was recorded also..

TITLE: Measurements of the physical properties of Antarctic fast ice and their variations throughout the growth season. ABSTRACT: The physical properties of Antarctic fast ice were investigated throughout a full year of growth. The aim of the project was three fold; 1) to document the basic physical properties of Antarctic fast ice (salinity, temperature, crystal structure, brine volume, sub ice platelet thickness, ice thickness and snow cover depth and density) and their variations throughout the growth season, 2) to measure the energy fluxes associated with ice growth over the same period in order to assess the applicability of thermodynamic ice growth models developed for the Arctic to Antarctica sea ice and 3) to measure the nature and magnitude of propagating flexural gravity waves in the ice. Almost all of the measurements were conducted on second year ice at a site roughly 1.5km directly offshore from Scott Base. Several transects were made in late winter and spring in which the ice, snow and sub ice platelet thicknesses were measured over a much greater area. Micro-meteorological data was collected including in-ice temperature profiles, net radiation, wind direction and two levels of each wind speed, air temperature and humidity. Strain gauges were installed at the site over water 290 m deep. Three gauges were bolted to the ice surface in a rosette pattern, at 120 degree angles. This pattern enables not only the strain experienced by individual gauges to be recorded, but allows the maximum strain in the horizontal plain and the direction of wave propagation to be determined as well..

TITLE: Canadian Coastal Photographs Collection. ABSTRACT: This collection consists of photographs of selected shorelines along Atlantic and Arctic Canada. The photos are oblique views of the shore taken since the early 1970's from a helicopter flying less than 0.5 km offshore at altitudes ranging from 100 m to 300 m. The photos provide information about shoreline morphology, sediment characteristics, coastal infrastructure, e.g. wharves, and nearshore seabed conditions, as well as inshore wave and sea ice conditions.Series of 35mm slides or prints are taken intermittently to illustrate physical characteristics along selected coastlines during one interval in time (1-2 days). They provide a reference for the mapping of shoreline types and sediment characteristics, and are used in marine oil spill contingency planning. Photographs were taken along Arctic coasts because of the lack of vertical air photos.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Weekly Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Parameters affecting sensory and metabolic adaptations in Antarctic vertebrates and invertebrates. ABSTRACT: The sense organs of three species of Antarctic fish and Antarctic octopus, scallops and collembolans were fixed for electron microscopy. Pigmented spots around the oral cavity of nemertean worms, the lateral line tissue of two fish species and the spinal cord from Pagothenia borchgrevinki were fixed for microscopy. Retinal samples of 8 species of Antarctic fish, the Antarctic octopus and some crustaceans were freeze dried for visual pigment analysis. The fluctuations in photopigment quantities over a 72 hour period in two species of Antarctic crustaceans using freeze dried samples of eyes from animals in their natural environment was investigated. The effects of elevated temperature on photopigment levels within the cell membrane and the crytoplasm was studied to determine the mechanism by which photopigment molecules are held in the membrane. Various tissues (spleen, liver, blood, etc) of two species of fish were sampled and freeze dried for studies on the nature of cold active enzymes. Blood samples of Dissostichus mawsoni were used to test the effectiveness of Antarctic fish blood antifreeze in the processing of meat. Digestive tissues from Antarctic nemertean worms were used to study the effectiveness of cold active proteolytic enzymes. The survival ability of different Antarctic species in contaminated water was tested. Water samples were analysed for chemical and biological activity. A freshwater mite was discovered in glacial melt water streams of the Taylor Valley..

TITLE: Year-round Urban Raven Surveys in Fairbanks, Interior Alaska 2004-2006. ABSTRACT: This dataset presents Raven (Corvus corax) survey data carried out for over two years at a supermarket parking lot (app. 300m*600m), strip mall, in Fairbanks, interior Alaska app. 120 miles south of the arctic circle. Data were collected bi-weekly, or with a higher frequency, on Sundays or Saturdays between 8 AM and 11 AM by driving on the parking lot for 15 minutes; detectability is believed to be 100 %. This results into unbiased surveys providing a snap shot in time. Other opportunistic surveys were included as well, e.g. collected during the week or from locations nearby. The parking lot represents a typical situation of Ravens in an urban habitat. Ravens were scanned for bands and marks, but none were found. Moult and age were also noted. Basic Raven behaviour is also reported, as well as state of the parking lot in regards to parked trucks and cars, food items, garbage, fast food left-overs, snow and climate. All other bird species were recorded as well, e.g. common gulls (Larus canus) in summer (almost no other species were seen). Bird abundance seems to be driven by food items on the parking lot, e.g. provided by an adjacent fast food restaurant and by left-overs from parties at the parking lot from the previous night. The numbers of Ravens at this study site are relatively small (app. 15 birds in winter and none in summer) and consistent patterns are shown. It is believed that the described situation applies to many other supermarket parking lots in the vicinity as well. It is suggested that these 2 years of data are unique and represent baseline information relevant for Ravens in the interior of Alaska; they are a simple but powerful snapshot in time and when put into an overall ecological context..

TITLE: 1996 Population (Ecumene) Census Data, Canada. ABSTRACT: The parts of Canada making up the 1996 Settled Area, (or Population Ecumene), represents a selection of the 5984 Census Subdivisions (CSD) as defined by Statistics Canada for the 1996 Census. The selection process essentially removes those CSDs with very large areas and or very low populations. Some of British Columbia's CSD boundaries have been further modified to better conform to the distinctive settlement patterns in the Cordilleran regions. The 1996 Settled Area is an attempt to balance the needs of national scale choropleth mapping with the spatial reality that the majority of Canada's land area contains very few people. The Settled Area represents more than 98% of the Canadian population captured in the 1996 Census of Canada.To offer statistics for analysis for educational purposes and policy making.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Weekly Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Small mammal sampling protocol for long-term ecological monitoring program.. ABSTRACT: Purpose: To focus on three species in the Rock Creek watershed of Denali National Park and Preserve in 1992: the northern red-backed vole, the tundra vole and the singing vole. Abstract: The small mammal investigations begun in the Rock Creek watershed of Denali National Park and Preserve in 1992 focused primarily on three species: the northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilis), the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus), and the singing vole (Microtus miurus). Captures were also recorded of northern bog lemmings (Synaptomys borealis) and shrews (Sorex spp.), but demographic information was not collected on these species. Geographic Description: Rock Creek Watershed in the Denali National Park and Preserve. Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central Alaska Range, approximately 210 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. Methodology: Two competing trapping methods were employed for the assessment of population changes over time. Trapping grids, described by Otis et al. (1978), are used primarily for the estimation of population abundance, but are adaptable for the estimation of density. With traps in a grid configuration, traps are placed uniform distances apart in lines separated by the same distance as traps within a line, forming a rectangular trap pattern..

TITLE: When the Weather is Uggianaqtuq: Inuit Observations of Environmental Change. ABSTRACT: Uggianaqtuq (pronounced OOG-gi-a-nak-took) is a North Baffin Inuktitut word that means to behave unexpectedly, or in an unfamiliar way. From the perspective of many hunters and elders in the Arctic, the weather has been uggianaqtuq in recent years. In this interactive, multi-media CD-ROM, Inuit from two communties, Baker Lake (Qamani'tuaq) and Clyde River (Kangiktugaapik) in Nunavut, Canada, share their observations and perspectives on recent environmental changes. The CD-ROM is a pilot project that uses media technology as an alternative way (as opposed to written reports) to document and communicate Inuit observations and knowledge. Maps, text, photos, video and music are integrated to help illustrate the changes Inuit have observed in their environment and the impacts on their livelihoods. The integrated components allow the user to search by topic or person; view interview clips in Inuktitut with English interpretations; view and print maps about environmental changes drawn by participants; view short videos with scenes from the communities; view summaries and photos of environmental changes and their impacts to the landscape and community life. Topics include sea ice, snow, wind, weather variability, changes in seasons, changes in activities, animals, and more. Please Note: This CD-ROM is Copyright Shari Fox, 2003 (the author).

TITLE: Model Output from MBL-GEM III for a Typical Tussock-Tundra Hill Slope, 1921-2100. ABSTRACT: This data set includes output data from the MBL-GEM III model for a typical tussock-tundra hillslope. The model outputs 154 different variables for 20 modeled square-meter plots. Modeled plots are spaced 5 m apart along a 100-m transect parallel to the water flow path down a uniform hillslope covered with tussock tundra. Diverse output variables include photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil moisture and respiration, among others. Yearly model results are available for the years 1921 through 2100, with climate drivers based on historical reconstruction of climate and carbon dioxide conditions (for 1921-2000) and two possible future climate scenarios (warmer and wetter climate versus warmer and drier climate, for 2001-2100). Each file included in this 40-file data set contains simulation results for one of the 20 cells for the entire time period, based on one of the two predicted climate scenarios..

TITLE: Terrestrial Ecosystem Model Output for Western Arctic Linkage Experiment (WALE). ABSTRACT: These data were obtained by running the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) with three different climate data sets over the Western Arctic Linkage Experiment (WALE) domain, which includes Alaska and the Yukon Territory. The carbon fluxes were compared with fluxes from the Biome-BGC model, and the water fluxes were compared with fluxes from the pan-Arctic Water Balance Model (PWBM). Data coverage is from 1980 through 2001. The data consist of fourteen binary file downloads, containing monthly gridded output in EASE-Grid format. Variables include gross primary production (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration, carbon flux, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture. PLEASE NOTE: These data and documentation files have not undergone the normal ADCC quality control procedures. This data set will not receive routine NSIDC User Services support until ADCC staff have completely prepared the data for publication. Until this disclaimer has been removed, users should send questions and comments about this data set to nsidc@nsidc.org. NSIDC will forward these inquiries to the PI for resolution.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Monthly Climatology Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: BIGFOOT FIELD DATA FOR NORTH AMERICAN SITES, 1999-2003. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BigFoot project gathered field data for selected EOS Land Validation Sites in North America from 1999 to 2003. Data collected and derived for varying intervals at the BigFoot sites and archived with this data set include FPAR, nitrogen content, allometry equations, root biomass, LAI, tree biomass, soil respiration, NPP, landcover images, and vegetation inventories.Each site is representative of one or two distinct biomes, including the Arctic tundra; boreal evergreen needleleaf forest; temperate cropland, grassland, and deciduous broadleaf forest; desert grassland and shrubland. The project collected multi-year, in situ measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics related to the terrestrial carbon cycle at the sites listed in Table 1. Companion files include documentation of measurement data, site and plot locations (Figure 2), and plot photographs for the SEVI and TUND sites (Figure 3).BigFoot Project Background: Reflectance data from MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites Terra and Aqua, was used to produce several science products including land cover, leaf area index (LAI), gross primary production (GPP), and net primary production (NPP). The overall goal of the BigFoot Project was to provide validation of these products. To do this, BigFoot combined ground measurements, additional high-resolution remote-sensing data, and ecosystem process models at six flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products. BigFoot characterized up to a 7 x 7 km area (49 1-km MODIS pixels) surrounding the CO2 flux towers located at six of the nine BigFoot sites. The sampling design allowed the Project to examine scales and spatial patterns of these properties, the inter-annual variability and validity of MODIS products, and provided for a field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint. BigFoot was funded by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program..

TITLE: AVHRR Polar 1 Km Level 1B Data Set. ABSTRACT: Please note that the machine on which these AVHRR data are processed has reached its life expectancy and will no longer be available as of 02 June 2008 until further notice. NSIDC collects and archives 1.1 km High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Local Area Coverage (LAC) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Original data are from recorded and rebroadcast LAC images for both polar regions and from several HRPT receiving stations, including McMurdo, Palmer, Casey, Fairbanks, Prince Albert, and Tromso. NSIDC receives these data from a polar subset of the EROS Data Center (EDC) Global Land 1 km AVHRR Data Set and from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, which collects Antarctic HRPT data from the McMurdo and Palmer stations. NSIDC received LAC data for the Southern Hemisphere through 1998 from a University of Colorado Domestic Satellite (DOMSAT) receiver and from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Satellite Active Archive (SAA) after 1998. These sources provide nearly complete coverage of sea ice, land ice, and polar land in the north and south polar regions, at 1.1 km resolution for all five bands of the AVHRR sensor. Data extend from April 1992 through the present for the Southern Hemisphere, and from August 1993 through the present for the Northern Hemisphere. Archived scenes, browse imagery, and information on location, time of acquisition, image size, and data quality are available via the AVHRR Polar 1 Km Level 1B Data Set Product Web site..

TITLE: CODAR Real time Long range vector fields. ABSTRACT: CODAR is used to measure the surface currents of the coastal ocean. A transmitter sends out a radio frequency that bounces off the ocean surface and back to a receiver antenna. Using this information and the principles of the Doppler shift, CODAR is able to calculate the speed and direction of the surface current. These calculations are made at about every half mile across the surface and extend as far as about twenty miles offshore. The following Data is available online: Raw Vector Field: The raw surface current is the unprocessed data measured by CODAR. Therefore these velocity fields are the summation of all sources of current, including tides and wind. Tidal Vector Field: This vector field represents the component of the raw velocity that is caused by tidal forcing. Detided Vector Field: The detided vector field contains all the surface currents shown in the raw velocity field with the exception of the tidal currents. Using the above periods, a predicted tide is calculated and then subtracted from the raw data field. Averaged Vector Field : The Averaged vector field is a 36 hour average of the detided field. Inertial Vector Field: The inertial vector field is calculated using a least squares fit to the detided data over the most recent 36 hours..

TITLE: Hydrographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean Data. ABSTRACT: The hydrographic atlas consists primarily of gridded fields of temperature, salinity and oxygen at 42 standard depths with a resolution of 1x1 degrees south of 30 degrees South. Additionally hydrographic station data are available as a separate data set. The idea to compile this hydrographic atlas of the Southern Ocean was prompted by a considerable increase in the number of observations for the Southern Ocean during the last two decades. A large collection of historical data not incorporated into previous work (&Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean&, Levitus, 1982; &Southern Ocean Atlas&, Gordon, Molinelli, Baker, 1982) was used in addition to the data from these atlases. Data from more than 38.000 stations were validated very carefully. Gridded fields were calculated subsequently by Objective Interpolation. The maps include error maps which allow estimates of the reliability of the analyzed parameter field. The atlas was produced in cooperation with AWI in Bremerhaven (Germany) and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St. Petersburg (Russia). Many other institutions have provided data and many scientists have freely shared their data and knowledge to support the project. The validated station data set and the gridded data can be obtained. The atlas is available for DM 500. including shipping (surface mail). All texts, tables and graphics from the Atlas can be found in the World Wide Web: &#039;http:  www.awi.de en home &#039;. The gridded data set is available via FTP: &ftp.awi-bremerhaven.de pub TPH tsoasc.grd.Z&.

ABSTRACT: Water quality monitoring is conducted, for all 22 National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) sites, at two locations within or adjacent to the Reserve. These two locations monitor a reference non-impacted site (baseline condition) and a non-point source pollution site. The following parameters are measured at least every 30 minutes: water temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (percent saturation and concentration mg L), pH, turbidity, and water depth. All water quality data loggers (YSI&#039;s) are deployed from a known depth from the bottom at each site. The Jacques Cousteau  Mullica River National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) site is located on the northeast coast of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean. The estuary is near Tuckerton, New Jersey about 14 kilometers north of Atlantic City. All four locations can be characterized by having no macroalgae and fast moving tidal currents. All sites are in an undisturbed area with little impact from development or pollution. There are four sampling stations: 1) Buoy 126 (B126) (39 deg 30.478&#039; N, 74 deg 20.308&#039; W) - is located three kilometers from Little Egg Inlet on the eastern side of Great Bay and is 100 meters from the nearest land which is a natural marsh island. This is a naturally deep area which has never been dredged. It is located about 0.5 kilometer from an area in the intracoastal waterway which is dredged regularly. The dredged material is a coarse sand. The data logger at this location is attached to Intracoastal Waterway Buoy 126 and is the closest monitoring station to Little Egg Inlet. 2) Buoy 139 (B139) (39 deg 29.883&#039; N, 74 deg 22.873&#039; W) - is located 4 kilometers from buoy 126 on the western side of Great Bay and is located about one to one and one-half kilometers from land. The closest land form is an extensive salt marsh about 1.5 kilometers wide which borders the upland area. This area is dredged on a on a regular basis every five to six years to maintained the channel at a depth of eight feet by the Army Corp of Engineers. The surrounding depth of the bay is about five to six feet deep. This site is characterized by having maximum currents of about 1.5 knots with a muddy sand bottom and with little structure or shell. The average depth is 2.47 meters with a range of 1.77 to 3.29 meters. The average pH is 8.0 with a range of 7.2 to 8.5 and salinity values averaged 26.1 with a range of 12.1 to 32.8 ppt. 3) Chestnut Neck (NECK) (39 deg 32.872&#039; N, 74 deg 27.676&#039; W) - is located 12 kilometers up the Mullica River from the mouth of the river. The River begins at a line drawn between Graveling Point and Oysterbed Point on the northwestern side of Great Bay. The Mullica River at this location is quite wide, about 250 meters. The data logger is attached to the dock of a small marina along the southern shore of the river adjacent to the main channel. This location has never been dredged. The average depth at this location is 0.87 meters with a range of from 0.00 to 1.48 meters. The depth in the middle of the Mullica River at this location is about six meters. The pH averages 7.3 for the year with a range of from 4.4 to 8.1. The average salinity here is 14.0 with a range of 0 to 25.4 ppt. The site is characterized by having tidal currents of less then one knot, during both ebb and flood tide, with a sandy bottom. 4) Lower Bank (BANK) (39 deg 35.618&#039; N, 74 deg 33.091&#039; W) - is located 13 kilometers upriver of the Chestnut Neck location. The Mullica River at this site is about two hundred maters wide. The data logger is attached to a bridge going over the Mullica River which was rebuilt three years ago and is located in the center of the river. The northern bank of the river is sparsely developed with single family houses and has a steep bank about five meters high. The southern shore has an extensive marsh and fresh water wetland area about three kilometer wide. This site can be characterized by having fast tidal currents, just over one knot, deep water, and fine sand sediment. The average depth is 1.65 meters with a range of 0.65 to 2.45 meters. The pH averages 5.8 with a range of 3.9 to 7.4. The salinity averages 2.2 with a range of from 0 to 15.1 ppt. The NERR data is collected to fulfill two major goals: to support state-specific non-point source pollution control programs by establishing local networks of continuous water quality monitoring stations in representative protected estuarine ecosystems; and to develop a nationwide database on baseline environmental conditions in the NERR system of estuaries. The NERR System-wide Monitoring Program seeks &to identify and track short-term variability and long-term changes in the integrity and biodiversity of representative estuarine ecosystems and coastal watersheds for the purposes of contributing to effective national, regional, and site specific coastal zone management&. This comprehensive program consists of three phased components: (1) abiotic factors (i.e. water quality & meteorological monitoring), (2) biodiversity monitoring, and (3) land use planning analysis. With the initial focus on phase (1), the NERR System-wide Monitoring Program will provide data necessary for site and inter-site baseline studies, trend analyses and impact assessment. Information for this metadata was taken from the Water Quality Data Dissemination Page and individual site pages..

TITLE: Satellite Imagery of Surface Water Temperature in Canada. ABSTRACT: The Maurice Lamontagne Institute remote sensing laboratory operates two satellite image receiving stations (Mont-Joli and Resolute Bay) allowing the acquisition of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellites data. Data are available as JPEG images for a series of nine regions covering Canada's coastal zones including Hudson Bay, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Atlantic and Scotian shelf regions, the Arctic, Beaufort, Baffin, Northwater polynya and the Pacific. Temporal coverage varies between regions as receiving stations became operational at different dates. Images acquired at every satellite overpass and weekly and bi-monthly means are available. The means are generated using available data from all operational satellites and include day and night data. After their acquisition, the images are filtered to eliminate the presence of clouds and ice and a land mask is applied. Images are navigated using a first approximation based on orbital parameters and refined using an automatic correspondence between ground control points observable from the coastlines within the images and a digital chart. Generally, the navigation precision is of the order of one pixel (1,1 km). Images for which the navigation quality is not acceptable are not taken into consideration into the calculation of the means. Sea surface temperatures are calculated using a split-window type algorithm using thermal channels from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Different algorithms are used for day and night captured images. The Terascan software (Seaspace Corporation) is use to navigate the images and calculate sea surface temperatures. Products generated by the processing system are validated against in-situ data acquired by the thermograph network.These data are processed to calculate sea surface temperatures and are used within oceanographic research projects and for ecosystem monitoring. These images allow the monitoring of the evolution of diverse physical processes and their coupling to biological processes.

TITLE: Sea Ice Index. ABSTRACT: The Sea Ice Index provides a quick look at sea ice changes in spatial and historical context, and gives a consistent, up-to-date source of sea ice extent and sea ice concentration values and images. The NSIDC Near-Real-Time DMSP SSM I Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations and the Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SSMR and DMSP SSM I Passive Microwave Data data sets are used to generate the monthly records of sea ice extent and sea ice concentration for the Arctic and Antarctica from satellite passive microwave data. Data files tabulate monthly mean extent and area, in millions of square kilometers, by year for a given month. Plots of monthly sea ice extent anomalies with trend lines and significance intervals are available. Monthly images show sea ice extent (with an outline of the median extent for that month for comparison), sea ice concentration, trends in sea ice concentration, and anomalies in sea ice concentration. Anomalies and median extent are calculated using a reference period of 1979 through 2000. Daily images of sea ice extent and concentration, along with a time series plot of extent for the most recent four months, can be viewed and downloaded on the data product site but are not archived. Some products are available as GIS compatible shapefiles and KML files. The Browse Image Spreadsheet Tool (BIST) can be used for animated images and for displaying archived images of extent and trends side by side, to make it easy to compare images from different years and months. Data are stored in ASCII text, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Keyhole Markup Language (KML), and Geospatial Vector Data format and are available from November 1978 to present via FTP or the Sea Ice Index Web site..

TITLE: Oxygen and Deuterium Isotope Measurements from Siberia, 2002-2004. ABSTRACT: Investigators performed a stable isotope analysis of rain, snow, the Kolyma River, and a local stream near Cherskii, Siberia from 30 June 2002 through 27 April 2004. As part of the Russian-American Initiative on Shelf-land Environments (RAISE) program, this research was designed to quantify the impacts of disturbance on the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the discharge of carbon and nitrogen into the Arctic Ocean in forest and shrubby tundra regions. Monitoring the stable isotopic composition of water runoff from Arctic rivers provides a means to investigate integrated basin-scale changes. Investigators measured river water and precipitation del18O and delD to partition the river flow into snow and rain components in the Kolyma River basin (Welp et al. 2005). Data are tab-delimited ASCII text files and are available via FTP. A supplementary graph of the data is also provided in JPEG format..

TITLE: BOREAS TGB-07 DRY DEPOSITION HERBICIDE AND ORGANOCHLORINE FLUX DATA. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-07 team measured the concentration and flux of several agricultural pesticides in air, rainwater, and dry deposition samples in order to determine the associated yearly deposition rates. This data set contains information on the dry deposition flux of seven herbicides [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacidic_acid (2,4-D), bromoxynil, dicamb, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), triallate, trifluralin, and diclop-methyl] known to appear in the atmosphere of the Canadian prairies. Also, the concentration of three herbicides (atrazine, alaclor and metolachlor), two groups of insecticides (lindane and breakdown products and dichlro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and breakdown products), and several polychlorinated biphenyls commonly used in the central United States were measured. All of these chemicals are reported, in the literature, to be transported in the atmosphere. Many have been reported to occur in boreal and arctic food chains. The samplin g was carried out from June 16 to August 13, 1993 and May 4 to July 20, 1994 at the BOREAS site in the Prince Albert National Park (Waskesiu)..

TITLE: Profiling hydrocarbons and nutrient distribution and mobility around Pedro Vicente Maldonado Station, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: Chemical transport occurs lateral and vertically. This project aims to study mobility and transportation of chemicals in Antarctica. Lateral transport of essential elements in an ecosystem is the definition of nutrient cycling. Nutrients are dynamic in the ecosystem; they travel from one trophic level to another. The faster the turnover time, the more productive the ecosystem is. In the tropics, photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide by using light energy from the sun to produce organic matter at the primary producer level while microbes are the main decomposers of derived organic chemicals back into inorganic elements and thus completing the nutrient cycle. The extreme conditions in Antarctica are not favorable to plants photosynthesis. Most of the primary producers are bound to the sea. The mechanisms to convey nutrients from the sea to the inland areas in Antarctica is not well defined. Hypothetically, birds play an important role as the conveyor. Digestive systems of the birds convert the organic matters back into inorganic nutrients for the terrestrial organisms during the short summer (Figure 1). Data obtained from this study shall enable the elaboration of the process in greater detail. As for the vertical transport, there is a well-known hypothesis; the “grass hopping” effect for long range transport of chemicals. Hypothetically, chemicals may transport through a long distance through the “grass hopping” effect. In fact, the existence of pesticides in polar bears in the Arctic was attempted to be explained by using the “grass hopping” types of long range transport. However, there are missing gaps in the southern hemisphere. Hence, this project is undertaken to study the long range transport by using petroleum hydrocarbons as a model..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 1A and Geolocation Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. Level-1A products contain the raw radiance counts from all bands as well as unpacked instrument telemetry. Level-1A data are used as input for geolocation and calibration processing. These products are used to derive all higher-level MODIS Aqua Ocean products as well as true color imagery. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html There are differences between the subsetted rescaled Level 1A produced and distributed by OBPG and the Standard Level 1A raw radiances (MYD01) produced by the MODIS Project. The MODIS Level 1A files that are produced, utilized, and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) are subsetted to remove bands and data that are not utilized for Ocean (SST and Ocean Color) product generation. In addition, selected Ocean visible bands, which saturate over land and clouds, are &extended& using information from other bands, to support the generation of true color images. Information about the OBPG MODIS subsetted Level-1A products can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov PRODUCTS Level_1A.html Geolocation files (GEO) are generated using standard SDST code (MOD_PR03). For the near-real-time (NRT) processing, the predicted attitude and ephemeris files are used to produce Quick-Look GEO files. Several days later, in the Refined processing stream, the definitive attitude and ephemeris files are used to create the final GEO version. GEO files are not maintained in the long-term archive, as they can be regenerated as needed using the much smaller attitude and ephemeris files. Therefore, only a short-term rolling archive is made available for distribution.

TITLE: RADARSAT Ortho-rectified Mosaic of Canada, Lambert Conformal Conic, 250 Metres. ABSTRACT: Initiated to provide an unique synoptic view of Canada using data acquired from Canada's first Earth Observation Satellite, this digital national mosaic has been produced at a 250m pixel spacing, in a Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection and is orthorectified to standard map bases. RADARSAT mosaic was produced using Canadian Space Agency's RADARSAT data archive and ScanSAR Narrow B descending mode data. The majority of the data, south of 60 degrees was acquired during the growing seasons of 1998 and 1999. The remaining data were collected during the winters of 1998 and 1999. The mosaic was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and with contributions from RADARSAT International (RSI).The development of this project celebrates the fact that RADARSAT-1, originally launched in November of 1995, has reached and passed its five year design life in orbit. The satellite continues to deliver imagery that has been proven effective in a wide range of applications including ice reconnaissance, disaster management, oceanography and agriculture. This digital product has been developed at a number of scales (technically pixel spacing) to allow a variety of users the ability to download and use this data.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Weekly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Administrative Boundaries, Canada. ABSTRACT: The Administrative Boundaries files comprise digital data sets that cover the entire Canadian landmass. The organizational unit for each data set is the National Topographic System (NTS), based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The ground data is depicted through lines and areas. Each data set (file) respects the UTM projection, planimetric coordinates and each feature has a single codification. Each file (data set) consists of one NTS unit at either the 1:50 000 or 1:250 000 scale. The digital data are represented by lines and areas. The initial version of the Administrative Boundaries file contains six types of entities: international boundaries, provinces, municipalities, national parks, national wildlife areas and migratory bird sanctuaries. A total of 13,351 files at the 1:50 000 scale and 980 files at the 1:250 000 scale are created for the entire Canadian landmass. The three data sources are from the International Boundary Commission, the Legal Surveys Division of Natural Resources Canada, and Statistics Canada.To provide other sources of digital topographic data information.

TITLE: Radiosonde Casts from the Koldewey Ground Station and Research Ship FS Polarstern (Arctic). ABSTRACT: These data are collected by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), Bremerhaven for the Arctic at the Koldewey Ground Station (79N,12E) since 1991 and at the research ship FS Polarstern since 1982. Upper air soundings are carried out routinely once a day normally between 10 and 12 UTC. They include profile measurements of pressure, temperature, relative humidity and wind vector. About once a week an additional ozone profile is retrieved as well. Usually the profiles start at the ground and end between 15 and 37 km. For the routine soundings VAISALA RS80 radiosondes, carried by helium-filled balloons (TOTEX 350, 600, 1200) are used. The data is coded (FM35-Temp) and transferred directly to the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) where they contribute to weather forecasting. To obtain the ozone profiles an additional ozone sensor (VAISALA, ECC5A) has been attached to the radiosonde. The wind vector is determined with the aid of the OMEGA navigation system. Data reception and evaluation are carried out by a DigiCora System (VAISALA). At AWI the upper air soundings are archived together with the routine synoptic weather observation and surface radiation and mast measurements in a relational database (SYBASE). Actual soundings normally reach the database once a month. Data are accessible via Web network by means of the AWI-Home-Page, 'http:  www.awi-bremerhaven.de', and can be obtained from AWI after prior consultation..

TITLE: Ice Core Volcanic Index2 Data. ABSTRACT: [Text Source: Gao, Chaochao, Alan Robock, and Caspar Ammann, 2008: Volcanic forcing of climate over the past 1500 years: An improved ice-core-based index for climate models. J. Geophys. Res., 113, D23111, doi:10.1029 2008JD010239.] Understanding natural causes of climate change is vital to evaluate the relative impacts of human pollution and land surface modification on climate. We have investigated one of the most important natural causes of climate change, volcanic eruptions, by using 54 ice core records from both the Arctic and Antarctica. Our recently collected suite of ice core data, more than double the number of cores ever used before, reduces errors inherent in reconstructions based on a single or small number of cores, which enables us to obtain much higher accuracy in both detection of events and quantification of the radiative effects. We extracted volcanic deposition signals from each ice core record by applying a high-pass LOESS filter to the time series and examining peaks that exceed twice the 31-year running median absolute deviation. We then studied the spatial pattern of volcanic sulfate deposition on Greenland and Antarctica, and combined this knowledge with a new understanding of stratospheric transport of volcanic aerosols to produce a forcing data set as a function of month, latitude, and altitude for the past 1500 years. We estimated the uncertainties associated with the choice of volcanic signal extraction criteria, ice-core sulfate deposition to stratospheric loading calibration factor, and the season for the eruptions without a recorded month. We forced an energy balance climate model with this new volcanic forcing data set, together with solar and anthropogenic forcing, to simulate the large scale temperature response. The results agree well with instrumental observations for the past 150 years and with proxy records for the entire period. Through better characterization of the natural causes of climate change, this new data set will lead to improved prediction of anthropogenic impacts on climate. The new data set of stratospheric sulfate injections from volcanic eruptions for the past 1500 years, as a function of latitude, altitude, and month, is available for download in a format suitable for forcing general circulation models of the climate system..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Monthly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Daily Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. The parameters are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Biodiversity. ABSTRACT: The Arctic Ocean is unique on Earth in its physical and biological properties. It is the most extreme ocean in regard to the seasonality of light and its year-round existing ice cover. Current knowledge indicates that the Arctic seas hold a multitude of unique life forms highly adapted in their life history, ecology and physiology to the extreme and seasonal conditions of their environment. Our knowledge of what currently lives in the Arctic Ocean is still rudimentary compared to most other regions, due to the logistical challenges imposed by its multiyear ice and inhospitable climate.

TITLE: RADARSAT Repeat-pass Interferometry. ABSTRACT: The feasibility of SAR interferomtry (InSAR) was examined and demonstrated using RADARSAT's Standard, Fine and ScanSAR modes. Based on evaluation of the projected equatorial satellite ground track drift, as provided by the Canadian Space Agency, several data sets with useful interferometric baselines over Bathurst Island, Northwest Territories, Canada were acquired. This study site provided dry and barren surface conditions, reducing the effects of temporal decorrelation over the 24-day repeat pass interval thus allowing generation of useful interferograms.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 2 Local Area Coverage (LAC) Geophysical Ocean Color Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Each Level-2 Local Area Coverage (LAC) product is generated from a corresponding Level-1B product. The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel, derived from the Level-1B radiances by applying the atmospheric corrections and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1B product and is stored in one physical HDF file. The resolution is the same as the corresponding level 1B file (1 km). The standard Ocean Color product contains the following geophysical values derived for each pixel: -Normalized water-leaving radiances at 412, 443, 488, 531, 551 & 667 nm -Chlorophyll a concentration -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 748 and 869 nm -Angstrom coefficient, 531 to 869 nm (for atmospheric correction) -Aerosol optical thickness at 869 nm (for atmospheric correction) In addition, 32 flags are associated with each pixel indicating if any algorithm failures or warning conditions occurred for that pixel. Detailed information on the Level-2 format specifications can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-2_Data_Products.pdf Level-2 processing is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSl12) code, which is developed and maintained by the OBPG. MSL12 is used for the standard processing of all ocean products distributed through the web browsers and FTP sites. This software is capable of retrieving oceanic optical properties and various derived products from the observed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances collected by a variety of ocean remote sensing radiometers, including MODIS. Full documentation, updated code source, sensor files, and output product descriptions can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MSL12 . For MODIS, the Level-1B file and the GEO file for each 5-minute granule are input to MSl12. The Level-2 processing also makes use of meteorological and ozone information from ancillary sources. In the near real-time (NRT) stream, climatological meteorological and ozone data are used. The NRT Quick Look products are then immediately available on the web browser and in the rolling FTP archive within 6-10 hours of observation. When the definitive attitude and orbit and coincident meteorological and ozone data are received several days later, they are used in the Refined processing stream, and the Level-2 products are regenerated.

TITLE: Benthic fauna in the Pechora Sea (EUROBIS). ABSTRACT: Quantitative samples of benthic fauna were collected at 15 stations for analysis of species distribution and faunal composition. Multivariate statistics indicate that the sampling stations cover a heterogeneous area with different types of community composition, as might be expected, since the Pechora Sea encompasses a wide range of depths and oceanographic conditions. However, some distinct station groupings were evident, which are considered to represent different faunal community types. Around the Island of Kolguyev, the fauna was dominated by sub-surface detritivorous Polychaeta. On the coast of Novaya Zemlya, the Chernaya Fjord contained an opportunistic faunal composition. The deep area immediately south of Novaya Zemlya was characterised by high numbers of large, surface deposit feeding Polychaeta. The Kara Strait area showed some spatial variation in faunal characteristics, but generally contained high numbers of surface deposit feeding Polychaeta and Crustacea, as well as encrusting suspensivores on stones. The stations sampled between Kolguyev and the Pechora Bay contained large amounts of macrofaunal Foraminifera and detritivorous Polychaeta, while the fauna sampled in the Pechora Bay was typical of northern, low salinity environments. Canonical correspondence analyses indicate that water depth and sediment type play a major role in structuring the benthic fauna. The distribution of community types described in this investigation largely follow those outlined in previous Russian investigations, despite the use of different analytical strategies. This investigation provides the background for an intercomparison of methodologies in faunal analyses.

TITLE: National Coal Resources Data System; USGS. ABSTRACT: The basic National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS) allows users to interactively retrieve information on coal quantity and quality and to build new resource data from ongoing research on the geology of coal by the U.S. Geological Survey and state agencies. The NCRDS is an automated system. Data bases accessed contain some proprietary data. Access to non-U.S. Geological Survey users is limited to nonproprietary data. NCRDS is a user-oriented computerized storage, retrieval, and display system devised by the U.S. Geological Survey to assess the quantity and quality of national coal resources. The U.S. Geological Survey has initiated a 5- to 10-year program to provide point-source coverage for the coal-bearing rocks in the U.S. Cooperative projects with many state geologic agencies have been funded to supplement U.S. Geological Survey work and to amass the volume of data required to assess U.S. coal resources. Currently, files containing summary areal coal tonnage estimates and proximate ultimate chemical analyses and point-located major, minor, and trace-element analyses are available. The point-source files are used to calculate resource estimates and to depict trends in the occurrence and chemical characteristics of coal. Primary data for measurements, coal-bed outcrop patterns, burned, channeled, and mined-out areas, and geochemical analyses. System software can calculate coal resource estimates, generate overburden or interburden distribution, and delineate areas of coal with selected quality parameters (for example, >1 percent sulfur, <50 ppm Zinc) within specified boundaries, (for example, county, quadrangle, or lease tract). Data may be displayed descriptively by preformated tables, user-determined listings, and selected statistics or graphically by two-and three-dimensional diagrams, trend surfaces, isoline maps, and stratigraphic sections. The system runs on a SUN Network of servers and workstations located in Reston, VA. and Denver, CO..

TITLE: MODIS Terra Cloud Mask and Spectral Test Results 5-Min L2 Swath 250m and 1km (Collection 004 and 005). ABSTRACT: MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands), and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at NASA Goddard DAAC and has been made available to public since April 2000. The MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime & nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MOD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel ( paulm@ssec.wisc.edu). MOD35_L2 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Each of the 9 gridded parameters is stored as a Scientific Data Set (SDS) within the HDF-EOS file. The Cloud Mask and Quality Assurance SDS's are stored at 1 kilometer pixel resolution. All other SDS's (those relating to time, geolocation, and viewing geometry) are stored at 5 kilometer pixel resolution. Each file is roughly 47.5 MB in size, and the total data volume is approximately 13.7 GB day.

TITLE: Marine Birds from Coastal Alaska and Puget Sound Data. ABSTRACT: Marine Bird Sighting, Ship Aircraft Census (F033) is one of a group of seven datasets related to Marine Birds from Coastal Alaska and Puget Sound Data (1974 -1982). Each dataset uses the NODC Taxonomic Code to indicate species. Marine Bird Sighting, Ship Aircraft Census (F033) contains data from field observations of marine birds made along ship or aircraft survey tracks. These data are collected to provide information on population density and distribution. Start and end position, date and elapsed time, speed and course, platform type and observing techniques are reported for each survey. Environmental information may include meteorological and sea surface conditions, distances to the shoreline and shelf break, ice characteristics within and outside each transect and surface debris, including oil slicks. Species data may include age, sex, color, plumage, number of individuals, direction of flight, behavior and food source association. Any number of species may be reported within one observation time span. These data were collected from 1975 - 1982 for coastal Alaska and adjacent North Pacific Ocean.

TITLE: International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) data at UCAR JOSS NOAA CODIAC. ABSTRACT: The International Tundra Experiment, ITEX, was established in 1990 as a MAB-NSN initiative (Man-And-the-Biosphere, Northern Sciences Network). Since then the programme has grown rapidly and is today one of the most active international field programmes in arctic ecology. The purpose of ITEX is to monitor the performance of plant species and communities on a circumpolar basis in undisturbed habitats with and without environmental manipulations. At present, there are over twenty active ITEX field sites throughout the circumpolar Arctic and in some alpine areas, operated by field parties from thirteen countries. The basic experiment is a temperature enhancement manipulation, where the field mean surface temperature is increased by 2-3 degrees C to simulate the climate at the middle of the next century according to the forecast from the GCMs (General Circulation Models). Most of the results generated within ITEX so far relate to the response of single species, but from the field season of 1995 the experimentation was scaled up to include community-level responses. There are also ITEX research efforts dealing with plant phenotypic plasticity and quantitative genetics of some of the target species..

TITLE: Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE_3A) Electra Chemical Data from the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE). ABSTRACT: The ABLE missions have been designed specifically to study the rate of exchange of material between the Earth's surface and its atmospheric boundary layer, and the processes by which gases and aerosols are moved between the boundary layer and the 'free' troposphere. These expeditions are conducted in ecosystems of the world that are known to exert a major influence on global atmospheric chemistry. In some cases, these ecosystems are undergoing profound changes as a consequence of natural processes and or human impact.ABLE 3A is a component of the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) sponsored by the NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Program. The Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3A) was conducted in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of North America and Greenland during July and August 1988. ABLE 3A was the first comprehensive investigation of the sources, sinks, and distribution of trace gas and aerosol chemical species in a northern high-latitude region during summer months. The ABLE 3A experimental design placed emphasis on the role of biosphere-atmosphere interactions in determining the chemical composition of the troposphere and on processes which influence the tropospheric ozone budget. The suite of chemical species measured included the following gases: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, total "reactive" nitrogen gas, nitric acid, peroxyacetyl nitrate, peroxypropionyl nitrate, ozone, and aerosol chemical composition and size distribution. The instruments used included a capacitive sensor, chilled mirror, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL), electron capture detector-gas chromatograph, grab samples gas chromatograph, inertial navigation system, photoelectric cell, resistance temperature detector, two photon laser induced fluorescence, and a tunable diode laser. The ABLE 3A results indicate that human activities may have already enhanced total "reactive" nitrogen inputs to the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions to the extent that the lifetime of ozone against photochemical loss may have already doubled. This data set consists of the aircraft measurements of chemical species. There are also ABLE 3A data sets for a ground site (GTE_A3A_TOWER), for isentropic back trajectories generated for the program time frame (GTE_A3A_MET_TRAJ) and a data set for airborne flux measurements of trace species (GTE_A3A_ELEC_FLUX). These data sets are also available from the Langley DAAC..

TITLE: Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program in Denali National Park. ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of the MAPS program is to provide annual indices of adult population size and post-fledging productivity, as well as estimates of adult survivorship and recruitment into the adult population, for various land bird species. Broad-scale data on productivity and survivorship are not obtained from any other avian monitoring program in North America and are needed to provide crucial information upon which to initiate research and management actions to reverse the recently-documented declines in North American land bird populations. A second objective of the MAPS is to provide standardized population and demographic data for the land birds found on federally managed public lands, such as national parks, national forests and military installations. Abstract: MAPS continued to grow from 178 stations in 1992 to 236 stations in 1993 (a 33% increase) and to 326 stations in 1994 (a 38% increase). Changes between 1992 and 1993 in adult population size and post-fledging productivity were determined from 144 stations operated in a constant-effort in the two years, while changes between 1993 and 1994 were derived from constant-effort data from 213 stations operated comparably in both years. Indices of adult population size generally tended to decrease between 1992 and 1993 all across the continent; the decreases in the Northwest were highly significant and may have been caused by the low recruitment of new breeders due to heavy, late-lingering snowpacks in montane areas throughout the Northwest Region. The patterns of decreases across the continent generally mirrored analagous patterns from the North American Breeding Survey (BBS). Productivity (proportion of young in the catch) also decreased significantly in the Northwest, but tended to increase elsewhere, particularly in the Northeast Region. Indices of adult population size tended to remain stable between 1993 and 1994 in the Northwest, tended to decline in the North-central Region, and showed mixed trends over the rest of the continent; most species that declined in 1993 appeared to recover somewhat in 1994. Population changes from MAPS between 1993 and 1994 mirrored analagous changes from BBS only in western regions. Productivity increased significantly in 1994 in the Northwest and tended to increase slightly in most other regions. Productivity indices were affected significantly by year, nest location, and migration strategy; cavity nesters and permanent resident species showed the highest productivity indices, while tree and (especially) shrub nesters and Neotropical-wintering species showed the lowest. Estimates of adult survival rates were obtained from four years (1991-1994) of data for the Northwest and Northeast regions and for all of eastern North America using the standard Cormack-Jolly-Seber ("non-transient") model and a newly developed "transient" model that provides estimates for the proportion of (summer) resident individuals among newly-captured adults and the survival probability of those resident birds. The transient model was selected as the most appropriate (or a competing) model [by means fo the Akaike Information Criterion (AID) for about 62% of the species. On average,use of the transient model increased estimates of survival and recapture probabilities by 34% and 41%, respectively, with little or no loss in the precision of the estimates. The increase in precision of estimates of survival rates by including a fourth year of data was comparable to a seven-fold increase in the number of stations contributing data.

TITLE: G. Dissemination Area Reference Maps, by Census Tract, for Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The set of Dissemination Area Reference Maps by Census Tract covers all 27 census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and the 19 census agglomerations (CAs) that are part of the census tract program. Each map in the set covers one census tract (CT) and shows the boundaries and codes of dissemination areas within that CT. The maps also show census tract, census subdivision, and census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries on a background of detailed street networks and other visible features such as rivers, lakes and railroad tracks. There are 6,157 maps in this set. (The dimensions of each map are approximately 27 cm by 43 cm (11 inches by 17 inches). Map scales vary according to the size of the census tract; thus the maps cannot be cut and pasted together. In cases where there is too much detail to show on one map, the census tract may be split into two or more maps. Clients are not charged for the extra maps resulting from the CT split. A reference guide is available (92F0146GIE). Note: Dissemination area reference maps are also available for smaller urban centres, that is, non-tracted census agglomerations (92F0147XCB, 92F0147XIB, 92F0147XPB), and by census division for areas outside census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations (92F0148XCB, 92F0148XIB, 92F0148XPB). Together, the three sets of dissemination area maps cover all of Canada.

TITLE: Geological Survey of Canada Open File Report 3125 Magnetic Anomalies of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans and Adjacent Land Areas. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The main objective of this project was to combine into a coherent grid, observations made during a period of several decades in different geographic locations and under variable circumstances. Many observations, especially the shipborne data, were collected continuously during the surveys, often in remote areas, with almost no regard with respect to the 'activity' of the geomagnetic field. Most of the aeromagnetic surveys were flown under conditions that are more restrictive. Lines were re-flown if magnetic conditions did not meet certain criteria. To combine these different sets into a coherent grid, it is very important to account for variations in the Earth's magnetic field. The shipborne data consists of 671 cruises collected during the period 1956-1992, a total of about 3 million line kilometers. Anomalies were re-calculated from the total field intensities using the appropriate IGRF coefficients (IAGA, 1991). Spikes and tares were identified and eliminated, with visual editing as a final step. After editing, the database consists of 659 cruises with a total of 6,540,581 data points. The aeromagnetic database consists of 145 surveys flown during 1966-1992. Generally, a fourth order difference filter was applied to detect erroneous points and to replace them with values obtained from a Naudy filter. After the fourth order processing, data were re-gridded to the standard grid: Transverse Mercator with a 5 km cell size and a central meridian of 50W. No extrapolation occurred beyond the limits of the original grid during the re-gridding process. At the conclusion of the processing, three independent data sets were available. About 900 internally adjusted shipborne data sets (685 surveys are entirely inside the study region), 150 uncombined aeromagnetic surveys, and about 25 different grids or as digitized contours data sets. The next step was to combine these data into one regional grid. The data sets were merge at the elevations that they were received. Each of the three data sets were gridded and then to these grids combined. Aeromagnetic data had higher preference during the merging process. The grids were combined in a standard merging procedure, using as a routine a 15 km overlap to taper one data set to the next. Rather than massaging the data and bending the grids to match, it was decided to remove from each grid the wavelengths longer than 400 km using the Hanning filter. Although it is difficult to give a complete quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the final magnetic grid, two attempts were made. The first attempt was a cross-over analysis. For a description of the second, a qualitative assessment, please see the Open File Report. The cross-over analysis gives an overall accuracy of observations at intersection points. The combined shipborne and aeromagnetic data set has a standard deviation of about 25-50 nT for most of the area, except in the northern part of the region, where it increases to about 100 nT. PURPOSE: The purpose of the project was to develop a digital data base of coherent magnetic observations suitable for quantitative tectonic interpretations. The data described here are the magnetic anomaly (long wavelength removed) gamma5 grid.

TITLE: Physical and Biological Factors Associated with Avian Cholera in Wetland Ecosystems. ABSTRACT: Purpose: 1. Determine whether wetlands are an important source of the avian cholera bacterium. - determine if P. multocida can be detected in marsh environments prior to avian cholera outbreaks. - evaluate the persistence of P. multocida in marshes following avian cholera outbreaks. 2. Determine the environmental factors that are associated with increased risk of avian cholera outbreaks and with persistence of P. multocida in wetlands. - evaluate the association of avian cholera outbreaks and selected wetland characteristics. - determine whether the persistence and survival of P. multocida in marshes is associated with wetland characteristics. Avian cholera, caused by the bacterium Pasterurella multocida, is a major disease of waterfowl and other wetland-dependent birds in North America. This explosive cause of mortality has infected over 100 species of wild birds and is the second most common disease of wildfowl in North America. The disease was unknown in wild birds in North America until the 1940s, although it had been an important disease of domestic poultry since the 1800s. Between 1944 and 1975, recurrent outbreaks of avian cholera in wild waterfowl were limited to the Playa Lakes area of Texas and the central valley San Francisco Bay area of California. Since 1975, avian cholera has increased in distribution and magnitude across North America, with epizootics ocurring annually at numerous locations from arctic breeding grounds to southern winterning areas. Losses of 1,000 birds per day occur frequently, with cummulative losses periodically exceeding tens of thousands in a single outbreak. Wildfowl losses to avian cholera have exceeded 25,000 birds during several outbreaks in the Chesapeake Bay and in Nebraska's Rainwater Basin. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain the recurrence of avian cholera outbreaks: 1) carrier animals reintroduce the disease as migratory birds congregate on staging and wintering areas, and 2) P. multocida persists in specific wetlands year-round in water, soil, or other reservoirs. Concurrent research at the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) is focusing on the suspected role of snow geese as carriers of avian cholera. However, little research has been done to systematically investigate the hypothesis that wetlands serve as the principal source of P. multocida that initiates avian cholera outbreak. Results from previous research have been inconsistent. Some researchers have detected P. multocida in Nebraska wetlands during an epizootic but failed to isolate the bacteria three days after the epizootic ended. Others have recovered P. multocida for up to 30 days from water samples associated with avian carcasses in a California marsh. Still another researchers could not demonstrate P. multocida in soils at an outbreak site either before, during or after a natural epizootic. Regardless of the source of P. multocida that initiates an outbreak, transmission is believed to be through inhalation of aerosols or ingestion of water contaminated with bacteria. Therefore, an understanding of the environmental factors affecting survival of P. multocida in wetlands may provide critical information in controlling avian cholera outbreaks or reducing losses. In addition, the reservoir for P. multocida and the means by which avian cholera is introduced to susceptible birds remain among the important unresolved questions in the epizootiology of this disease. Sample areas throughout the US include those that have avian cholera outbreaks. The major areas are indicated below, however, sampling from some other areas has included Stillwater NWR in Nevada, Humboldt Bay NWR in California, Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, Playa Lakes of Texas, Missouri, Sacramento, CA, and Tule Lake NWR, California. Methodology: Field sampling and laboratory processing methods were developed and refined during 1995 to standardize collection methods and enhance the recovery of P multocida from environmental samples. Equipment and methods for collecting environmental data from wetlands were procured and standardized. Protocols to standardize collection and processing of wetland samples were developed and refined. Several new techniques for collecting and processing wetland water and soil to isolate P. multocida were evaluated. Experimental evaluations of these methods indicate that P. multocida concentrations between 2.2 and 22 organisms ml can be successfully detected in wetland water samples..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Mapped 9 KM Yearly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Cloud-Radiation Feedback: Boundary Layer Cloud Microphysical Properties and Processes. ABSTRACT: This data set includes Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) cloud microphysical data collected onboard the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) C-130 aircraft. This work focused on improving the quality of algorithms used to process in situ measurements collected during First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment, Arctic Cloud Experiment (SHEBA FIRE, ACE) and applying the results to the analysis of five case studies. Such research was deemed valuable as a result of weaknesses and inconsistencies in the existing C-130 data set that were pointed out in a SHEBA workshop held in 2000. Data has been reprocessed by SPEC, Inc. to improve quality and add value to the measurements. Investigators selected five research days that were considered to be high priority by the SHEBA science team: 4 May, 8 July, 18 July, 28 July, and 29 July of 1998. New software algorithms and procedures were developed to objectively combine the measurements from the NCAR C-130 forward-scattering spectrometer probe (FSSP), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)-King probe, 260X probe, 2D-C probe, and 2D-P probe which were made by Particle Measuring Systems, Inc. (PMS) along with a Cloud Particle Imager (CPI) made by SPEC, Inc. Prior to this work, 2D-probe data had not been analyzed quantitatively; the 260X probe data were used instead. It was found that using the 260X data resulted in severe underestimation of ice water content (IWC), radar reflectivity and effective particle size in most mixed-phase regions of cloud. The software developed for this research performed several functions. CPI data were separated into water drops and ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds. Ice crystals were classified according to crystal type. An improved algorithm was developed to calculate IWC based on digitization and re-analysis of ice crystal and melted-drop images. The new algorithms were applied to the calculation of IWC, extinction coefficient, radar reflectivity, and ice particle effective size..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Millennial Scale Fluctuations of Dry Valleys Lakes: Implications for Regional Climate Variability and the Interhemispheric (a)Synchrony of Climate Change. ABSTRACT: This Collaborative Research award supports a project headed by Dr. B. Hall to add to the understanding of what drives glacial cycles near the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Her project aimed to integrate the geomorphological record of glacial history with a series of cores taken from the lake bottoms in the Dry Valleys of the McMurdo Sound region of Antarctica. The chronology, necessary to integrate the cores with the geomorphological record, as well as for comparisons with Antarctic ice-core and glacial records, would come from Uranium-Thorium, Uranium-Helium, and Carbon-14 dating of carbonates, as well as luminescence sediment dating. This Collaborative award enabled application and tests of a range of luminescence sediment-dating procedures to siliclastic silt and sand fractions from lake cores (Fryxell in Taylor Valley and Vanda in Wright Valley), lake-shore deposits (active deltas), and ice-surface sediment (Vanda and Fryxell). A Supplement to this award enabled similar efforts to be applied to ice-surface and short-core deposits from Lake Hoare (also in Taylor Valley), as well as to paleo-deltas at Lake Fryxell. The luminescence procedures employed included: multi-aliquot, polymineral fine-silt (IR-stimulation for feldspar signals), single-aliquot, multi-grain sand-size quartz (blue diode stimulation), and single-grain quartz (green laser stimulation). The data set for the Collaborative award will thus include a variety of luminescence age estimates, some compared to independent age estimates (either from C-14 on carbonacious matter or known modern settings [thus of 'zero age']). The purpose of this data set from the Supplement award was to determine which of these procedures and which of the sediment fractions (each often representing a different depositional process, ergo a different daylight-exposure history, daylight exposure being the 'clock-zeroing' mechanism) would provide the most accurate age estimates for the burial time of the sediment. The purpose of the main Collaborative award data set was to exploit the results from the Supplement experiments to obtain accurate ages of sediment burial for selected horizons within the cores. Unfortunately, several of the cores (e.g., those from Lake Vanda, most from Lake Fryxell) were disturbed during shipment from Antarctic to Reno, thus limiting the number of core samples available for dating analyses..

TITLE: Geothermal Observations From Canadian Boreholes, Mines and Hydrocarbon Wells. ABSTRACT: Geothermal data containing measurements of temperature, conductivity, heat generation, and rock petrology observation data that have been measured from Canada's landmass have been compiled in the Canadian Geothermal Data compilation. The data have been assembled from several data sets, paper files and even field notebooks, and refer to sites that include shallow boreholes, mines, and hydrocarbon exploration wells. The data are preserved in the form of original observations with no selection or correction of any kind. Supporting detail is included to permit the user to make judgements of quality and of options for selective use. The comprehensive compilation was started by the Geothemal Group of the Earth Physics Branch from 1962-1986, and then maintained and expanded by volunteer scientists determined to save the results of their efforts and make this valuable resource accessible to many future applications. These data have a wide range of use and can be applied to different geotechnical applications such as deep permafrost mapping, frozen ground reaction, gas hydrates, geothermal resource exploration, hydrocarbon charge modeling, rock property studies for nuclear waste disposal, hydrological analysis, and climatic change.

TITLE: Cod Growth Data. ABSTRACT: Data from Cod Growth Workshop, May 8-10 2000, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada. The workshop was proposed by the ICES GLOBEC Working Group on Cod and Climate Change. The terms of reference for the workshop were: - To develop models of growth in order to improve the quality of stock forecasting; - To describe major sources of uncertainty in further improving the prediction of growth rate and advise on further studies to reduce the uncertainty; - To assess the contribution of growth rate variability to the observed variability in stock biomass and stock forecasts; and - to recommend standard methods for comparing growth rates. Growth rate varies widely among cod stocks. Large changes in growth rate have also been observed within many cod stocks. This variation in growth rate has important consequences for the productivity of these stocks. Variation in growth rate may reflect effects of temperature change, density dependence (i.e., changes in per capita prey availability due to variation in prey or cod abundance), changes in maturation schedules, changes in size-selective fishing mortality, or genetic variation. An understanding of the causes of variation in growth rate among and within cod stocks may lead to improved forecasts of stock biomass and productivity, and is required to assess the likely impacts of climate change on cod populations. To facilitate the exchange of data and ideas, a Discussion Bulletin Board for the workshop will be maintained at the ICES GLOBEC Internet site ("http:  www.ices.dk globec globec.htm"). This webpage contains information on where to get Cod Growth Data for areas of interest to ICES.

TITLE: BEDMAP ice-thickness database. ABSTRACT: Data describing the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet collected on surveys undertaken over the past 50 years have been brought together into a single database. These data have allowed the compilation of a suite of seamless digital topographic models for the Antarctic continent and surrounding ocean. The suite includes grids representing: * ice-sheet thickness over the ice sheet and shelves * water-column thickness beneath the floating ice shelves * bed elevation beneath the grounded ice sheet * bathymetry to 60?S including the areas beneath the ice shelves. These grids are consistent with a recent high-resolution surface elevation model of Antarctica. While the digital models have a nominal spatial resolution of 5 km, such high resolution is not strictly justified by the original data density over all parts of the ice sheet. The suite does however provide an unparalleled vision of the geosphere beneath the ice sheet and a more reliable basis for ice sheet modelling. The bed elevation DEM, which includes the entire geosphere south of 60?S, provides an improved delineation of the boundary of the boundary between East and West Antarctica and sheds new light on the morphology of the contiguous East Antarctic landmass, much of which is buried below an average of 2500 m of ice. The database is available at the following URL: http:  www.antarctica.ac.uk index.php.

TITLE: MODIS Terra Sea Ice Extent Daily L3 Global 1km EASE-Grid Day V003. ABSTRACT: Sea ice products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) include level 2 swath data and level 3 gridded day and night composites, at 1 km resolution. Level 3 products consist of tiles of data, approximately 1200 km by 1200 km in area, gridded in a Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (EASE-Grid) projection. The sea ice algorithm uses a Normalized Difference Sea Ice Index (NDSI) and other criteria to distinguish sea ice from open ocean, based on reflective characteristics. The level 3 day product (MOD29P1D3) contains the following fields: Sea Ice by Reflective Characteristics, Sea Ice by Reflective Pixel Quality Assurance (QA), Ice Surface Temperature (IST), IST Pixel QA, Sea Ice by IST, and Combined Sea Ice. The data also contain local and global metadata. Latitude and longitude geolocation fields are at 5 km resolution, while all other fields are at 1 km resolution. Sea ice data are in HDF-EOS format and are available by ftp. MODIS sea ice products are considered provisional at this time. Product quality may not be optimal, and incremental product improvements are still occurring. This data set represents Version 3 (V003) of the MODIS processing scheme. The V003 collection contains reprocessed V001 data from 5 March 2001 onward and V003 data from 24 May 2001 onward. V003 data contain processing refinements accommodating algorithm, instrument and calibration stabilization. V003 start dates will continually shift to earlier dates as V001 data are reprocessed to V003. After V003 data are generated for a given day, the V001 data for the same day will still be available for ordering through the EOS Data Gateway (EDG) for at least six months. Eventually, V003 data will completely replace V001 data..

TITLE: LANDSAT 4 5 TM Raw Products. ABSTRACT: Landsat TM data are available from December 1982 to February 1983 (Landsat 4) and from April 1984 onwards (Landsat 5). Most of the ESA archive has been acquired and processed at receiving stations in Fucino (Italy), Kiruna (Sweden) and Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain). However, the archive contains also a substantial number of data acquired and processed by receiving stations elsewhere (e.g. the US, Brasil, Canada, etc). A Landsat 4 and 5 TM scene has an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1 through 5 and band 7, band 6 has an IFOV of 120 square meters on the ground. The resolution for the TM sensor is shown below: --------------------- Resolution Landsats 4-5: (meters) Band 1: 30 Band 2: 30 Band 3: 30 Band 4: 30 Band 5: 30 Band 6: 120 Band 7: 30 -------------------- Landsat TM Raw data is available in a digital format for: - Full scene: Full scenes cover approximately 183 x 172.8 km. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection between a path and row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 20 km). For a floating full scene the placement along the path is chosen by the customer. The centre point of the floating full scene is defined by the path number and the required latitude. A full image is composed of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each band requires 40 Mbytes of storage space. - Quarter scene: ESA TM data (digital or photographic) is available in quadrants, each measuring 91.5 x 86 km. This option is available for raw data, system corrected or geocoded products. Numbering of standard quarter scenes is as follows: for floating quarter scenes the placement along-path and across-path is chosen by the customer. The centre of the floating quarter scene is defined by latitude and longitude. - Mini scenes: ESA TM data is available as images covering an area 47.2 x 44 km (a 16th of a full scene). This option is available for raw data, system corrected or geocoded products. The scenes are floating and the placement along-path and across-path is chosen by the customer. The centre of the scene is defined by latitude and longitude. To order data please see "http:  earth.esa.int helpandmail help_order.html".

TITLE: Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement III (POAM III) Data at NRL. ABSTRACT: The Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement III (POAM III) instrument is similar to POAM II, and is designed to extend the POAM II data in time. POAM III is carried by the SPOT-4 spacecraft sponsored by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency and was launched in 1998. The POAM III retrieval version 2 includes the following profile data: (1) Ozone concentration, 5-60 km (2) NO2 concentration, 20-40 km (3) Aerosol extinction at 1018 nm, 10-30 km (4) Water Vapor, 5-45 km (5) UKMO temperature, pressure, and potential vorticity, 0-60 km The ancillary profiles of temperature, pressure, and potential vorticity from the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) have been interpolated to the location and time of the POAM III measurements. The MSISE-90 model has been used to extend these profiles above the top UKMO pressure level. The time span for the data is April 22, 1998 to present. The data are distributed by NRL and can be obtained in several formats, including ascii format, HDF, and IDL save files. Data requests and questions can be made by email to mailto:karl.hoppel@nrl.navy.mil.

TITLE: Preliminary studies on diversity of soil microfungi from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. ABSTRACT: Preliminary results of microfungi isolated from soils of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway during the familiarisation trip in July 2006 will be presented. Twenty three soil samples were collected during from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway in July 2006. Nineteen samples were collected around Ny-Ålesund while another four were from sea sediment. Soil samples were plated using modification of Warcups soil plating method. Approximately 1 gram of soils was placed in Petri dish and cooled autoclaved potato dextrose agar (PDA) was poured on the Petri dish containing the soil. The Petri dishes were shook horizontally to distribute the soils evenly. Soil plates were incubated at 4 ºC and 25ºC (room temperature). In total, 89 fungal species including three yeasts were isolated from soil of Svalbard, Norway. Sixty one species were isolated from plates incubated in 25ºC and 44 species were isolated from 4ºC. Sixteen species occurred in both 25 and 4ºC. High number of fungal species recorded in 25ºC than 4ºC, while about 18 percent of total isolated fungi live in both 4ºC and 25ºC. Runnel sediment (05 Runnel) gives the highest number of fungal occurrence followed by sample 34 Old Mine Mound and sample 15 Glacial Sediment. Sample 05 Runnel showed the highest number of occurrence with 33 fungal species occurred in total. Twelve species occurred at 4ºC and 22 species occurred at 25ºC. Sp. 6 occurred at both temperatures. Twenty five fungal species occurred from sample 34 Old Mine Mound where eight species were isolated at 4ºC and 18 species were isolated at 25ºC. Sp. 8 and Sp. 18 were isolated from both 4 and 25ºC. Twenty one fungal species occurred from sample 15 Glacial Sediment, 13 species were isolated from plates incubated at 4ºC and nine species at 25ºC only one species that is Sp.47 was isolated from both 4ºC and 25ºC. The most frequent occurred species in this study are Sp. 1 and Sp. 3 with 15.76 and 14.67 percent of total occurrence. Sp. 1 was isolated from 15 sites with 29 occurrence recorded while Sp. 3 was isolated from 12 sites and 27 occurrence recorded. Sp. 2, 6, 9 and 10 were isolated more frequent than the rest of the fungal species. No fungal species was isolated from sample 10 Twin Lake  (foam) and 30 AWS 20m deep sea sediment drilling 6-8cm. Out of 89 isolated fungal species only 28 species are psychrophilic. Sixteen species are psychrotrophic fungi and 45 species are mesophilic. Low number of psychrophilic fungi was recorded compared to mesophilic fungi..

TITLE: Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna (CAFF). ABSTRACT: When the Ministers of the Arctic countries adapted the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) in 1991, they signalled out habitat conservation as an area for special attention. Consequently when the International Working Group for the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) met at its inaugural meeting in 1992, it included Arctic habitat conservation as a priority in its Work Plan. Norway, on behalf of the eight Arctic countries, accepted the task of examining the current status of habitat protection within the Arctic countries as the first phase of CAFF's long-term strategy on habitat. This datasets holds data concerning existing protected areas in the Arctic.

TITLE: Decomposition, nitrogen mobilization, nitrogen fixation and the importance of lakeside foams in fellfield soils of the Garwood Valley. ABSTRACT: Nitrogen, a necessary nutrient for plants and microbes, is frequently limiting in soils. Nitrogen fixation and decomposition, both ways plants and microbes obtain nitrogen, are very slow processes in Antarctica and probably not ecologically important. However, little work has been reported on this subject in Antarctica, and therefore this study's aim was to determine the extent of and factors and processes involved in fixation and decomposition of wet fellfield soil in the upper Garwood Valley. The biomass of algae (live and dead tissue) was determined in the fellfield soils between the Joyce and Garwood Glacier snouts. The metabolic weight loss of these tissues was experimentally determined and bacteria were isolated from the samples. The mobilization of nitrogen from an organic to an inorganic form and nitrogen fixation rates were studied. The ecological importance of foams which occur extensively on the lakesides and flushed soil surfaces was also investigated by culturing the microbes contained within..

TITLE: Thaw Depth and Vegetation Radiance Measurements, Happy Valley, AK, 1994. ABSTRACT: This data set contains measurements for permafrost active layer thaw depth and vegetation reflectance (red and near-infrared bandwidths) at the Happy Valley Flux Study Site in northern Alaska during the summer of 1994. Sampling was conducted in a 1000-m square grid pattern, with sample points spaced 100 m apart. Median values for thaw depths were determined from five replicate measurements using a thaw probe. Vegetation radiance values are averages of five measurements collected from an area approximately 5 square meters at each grid point. Radiometric measurements were collected with Exotech-100BX, 4-channel radiometers fit with spectral filters corresponding to the SPOT HRV-XS satellite bandwidths..

TITLE: CRYSYS Snow Research, Canada. ABSTRACT: Main thrusts in CRYSYS snow-related research are: (1) the development and validation of microwave algorithms for snow cover properties (extent, water equivalent, wet dry state) in varying landscapes, and the synergism between active and passive microwave data for snow studies; and (2) reconstruction of historical snow cover from conventional and remotely sensed data to document and better understand long-term variability in snow cover.1. Develop, validate and refine empirical and theoretical algorithms for snow cover properties (extent, water equivalent, wet dry state) in varying landscapes using passive and active microwave data. 2. Integrate multi-sensor data to produce snow cover maps of selected regions of Canada. 3. Provide snow state variables for input to distributed hydrologic and coupled hydrologic-atmospheric models to monitor the snowpack, estimate runoff, and feedback to the atmosphere. 4. Assess the compatibility and applicability of data and products from current operational passive microwave sensors (SSM I) with EOS data (e.g. AMSR, MODIS). 5. Document and understand variability in snow cover and snow cover climate interactions over a range of spatial and temporal scales from merging of in situ and remotely-sensed data. 6. Contribute to the validation of snow cover and snow climate hydrological interactions in models (e.g. global regional climate and atmospheric models). 7. Rescue significant Canadian snow cover data sets e.g. daily snow depth and snow course observations.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Arctic and Southern Ocean Sea Ice Concentrations. ABSTRACT: Monthly sea ice concentration for Arctic (1901 to 1995) and Southern oceans (1973 to 1990) were digitized on a standard 1-degree grid (cylindrical projection) to provide a relatively uniform set of sea ice extent for all longitudes, as a basis for hemispheric scale studies of observed sea ice fluctuations (Walsh 1978). The Arctic grid covers the Arctic Ocean and portions of peripheral seas where sea ice occurs during all or part of the year. The Southern Ocean grid extends to approximately 50 degrees south latitude. Potential uses of this data set include statistical analysis of anomalies in different regions, computing regional and hemispheric trends, and modeling the high latitude surface energy budget. Data sources are U.S. Fleet Weather Facility, U.S. Navy National Ice Center (formerly Navy NOAA Joint Ice Center), U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, Canadian Department of Transport, British Meteorological Office, Danish Meteorological Institute, Norwegian Polar Institute, and Icelandic ice summaries. Data are available via ftp. Software to select and print grids by date is also available..

TITLE: GIS Data from the Alaska North Slope. ABSTRACT: This data set includes ArcInfo-formatted maps of the Kuparuk River Basin Region of the Alaskan North Slope (at 1:250,000 scale) and five subset study areas: the Upper Kuparuk River Basin Subregion (1:25,000), the Imnavait Creek Landscape (1:6,000), the Toolik Lake Landscape (1:5,000), the Imnavait Creek Grid (1:500), and the Toolik Lake Grid (1:500). Land cover (satellite-derived) and elevation data (USGS DEM-derived) are provided for the Kuparuk River Basin Region. For the five subset areas, an integrated terrain unit mapping (ITUM) approach simultaneously mapped vegetation and other terrain features as interpreted in the field from a common aerial-photograph base. The result is a single ITUM map for each area, including vegetation, geomorphology, glacial geology, and many other features. Various supplemental maps (e.g., hydrologic features and roads) for each of the areas are available for use as overlays..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Climatology Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Ross Embayment till provenance from sand petrography. ABSTRACT: Sand petrographic data were collected on the 500-2000 micron fraction of LGM-age till from the Ross Embayment. Moraine samples from the Beardmore, Byrd, Darwin Hatherton Glaciers, Mt. Achernar and Allan Hills were obtained from Dr. Gunter Faure (Ohio State) and Dr. James Bockheim (U. of Wisconsin, Madison). Samples of till from beneath the Siple Coast Ice Streams were obtained from Dr. Hermann Engelhardt (Cal Tech). Ross Sea till samples were obtained from the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (FSU). A few grams of unsieved splits of most of the samples, as well as the grain mounts of the sand fraction are housed at the Sediment Analysis Lab at IUPUI. The data generated from this project include percentage data of mineral and lithic fragments, particle size distributions and elemental abundance. Isotopic analyses of the samples were completed by Dr. Lang Farmer (Univ. of Colorado, Boulder)..

TITLE: Nimbus-5 ESMR Polar Gridded Brightness Temperatures. ABSTRACT: The Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) data set consists of gridded brightness temperature (TB) arrays for the Arctic and Antarctic, spanning 1972-1977. The data were gridded to a polar stereographic projection at 25 km resolution and adjusted to partially remove instrument drift and sensitivity shifts. The ESMR instrument senses horizontally polarized radiation at a frequency of 19 GHz. Two sets of TBs are available: one consists of the original daily-averaged data gridded to the polar stereographic projection, and the second consists of TBs adjusted to partially compensate for instrument drift and sensitivity shifts. Daily data that could not be adjusted are missing from this updated data set. Data are in 2-byte integer flat-binary format, and are available via FTP..

TITLE: Pakitsoq carbon-14 of methane and supporting gas data. ABSTRACT: This data set includes carbon-14 measurements on atmospheric methane obtained from air bubbles in glacial ice at the Pakitsoq outcrop in western Greenland, during two abrupt increases in methane concentration during the last deglaciation (14.7 and 11.6 kyr BP). Supporting measurements of oxygen-18 of O2, nitrogen-15 of N2, methane concentration, and oxygen-18 of ice used to establish the chronology are also included. The data were collected between 2001 and 2005 in a test of the "clathrate hypothesis", that massive releases of methane from marine methane hydrates caused the observed abrupt increases in atmospheric concentration at those two times..

TITLE: SHEBA Ocean Turbulence Mast Data Archive. ABSTRACT: This data set includes a time series of temperature, conductivity, salinity, three-dimensional velocity, pressure, and magnetic heading at multiple levels in the boundary layer under the drifting ice floe. As part of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project, data were collected continuously for the approximately year-long experiment. However, the experiment was divided roughly in half when a severe deformation event occurred in March 1998. After this event, the ocean camp was shifted to a new site farther into the SHEBA floe. In the first half of the experiment (October 1997 through March 1998), there were four turbulence instrument clusters (TIC) that included three mechanical rotor current meters, which sensed the mean flow velocity. These were oriented approximately at 4 m, 8 m, 12 m, and 16 m below the ice-ocean interface in the western Arctic Ocean. For the second half of the experiment (April through September 1998), only two TICs were deployed on the mast. The clusters measured mean quantities, turbulent momentum, and heat fluxes with reasonable approximations to salinity flux..

TITLE: European Diatom Database-Kola Peninsula pH Dataset. ABSTRACT: The European Diatom Database (EDDI) is a web-based information system designed to enhance the application of diatom analysis to problems of surface water acidification, eutrophication and climate change. The Kola diatom-pH training set comprises 24 small oligotrophic lakes located along a vegetation gradient in the central and western parts of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. The surface sediment diatom flora from the KOLA lakes is typical for oligotrophic, diluted arctic and alpine lakes. The diatom assemblages from the KOLA lakes are close floristically to the assemblages from the ALPE lakes (Cameron et al., 1999) and to the assemblages from northern Sweden (Korsman and Birks, 1996). The diatom optima generated by the KOLA model are generally in agreement with the optima derived by other models (e.g. ALPE) although KOLA diatom optima are generally higher compared to the ALPE and SWAP..

TITLE: Seismic reflection and refraction survey of Scoresby Sund and adjacent fjords (E Greenland), 1990 1994 (projects ARK-VII 3b, ARK-X 2). ABSTRACT: The aim of the seismic reflection and refraction measurements of the ARK-VII 3b expedition was to: a) map the crustal structure of totally different geological units in a region of close proximity, b) map the sedimentary distribution and the western boundary of the Mesozoic sediment basin of Jameson Land, c) map especially the Quaternary sediments to reconstruct the extension of the Quaternary glaciers and the different glacial phases. Shot interval was 25 m to 50 m for the reflection and 50 m to 75 m for the refraction seismic data. The data are in processing now with emphasis on velocity analysis and multiple suppression for the seismic reflection data. The following instruments were used: 100 and 800 m long streamer (24 channel), 6 and 32 l airgun array, 0.5 litres watergun, 32 l airgun. 6-channel Reftek stations, PCM stations with seismometers and geophone arrays. The geographical coverage is as follows: ARK-VIII 3b: 2440 km of multi-channel reflection seismic and 2440 km of refraction seismic data, and ARK-X 2: 1000 km of multi-channel reflection seismic and 1800 km of refraction seismic data, covering the whole of Scoresby Sund and adjacent fjords.

TITLE: Thickness, Salinity and Stable Isotope Composition of Sea Ice Samples from the Laptev Sea, 1999. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of sea ice measurements including thickness, salinity, and stable isotope composition from the Laptev Sea. The data were obtained during the Transdrift VI expedition to the Laptev Sea in April and May of 1999 as part of a project supported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. Sea ice cores were obtained with a 10 cm diameter corer. Ice thickness was measured in centimeters at the site with a tape measure. On-site, 2 cm thick horizontal sections were cut approximately every 10 cm down the core. Salinity of each sample was determined in practical salinity units (psu) using a salinity, conductivity, and temperature meter with an error of less than 0.02 or 1 percent of bulk salinity. Oxygen stable isotope (delta oxygen-18, or delta 18-O) measurementsts were then performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) on a mass spectrometer at a precision of better than 0.4 parts per thousand, (ppt, 10^3). Data are in a comma-separated variable ASCII format, and are available for download via FTP. Data are compiled for each coring location, though stable isotope measurements were not obtained for all samples..

TITLE: Subtropical North Atlantic Alkenone Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: A reconstruction of sea surface temperature based on alkenone unsaturation ratios in sediments of the Bermuda Rise provides a detailed record of subtropical climate from 60,000 to 30,000 years ago. Northern Sargasso Sea temperatures changed repeatedly by 2 to 5C, covarying with high-latitude temperatures that were previously inferred from Greenland ice cores. The largest temperature increases were comparable in magnitude to the full glacial-Holocene warming at the site. Abrupt cold reversals of 3 to 5C, lasting less than 250 years, occurred during the onset of two such events (Greenland interstadials 8 and 12), suggesting that the largest, most rapid warmings were especially unstable..

The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level-3 9 km merged chlorophyll products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods once the refined products for each of the contributing missions are processed. Increased coverage over the single mission product is realized through the merging of the two data sets. There is a substantial improvement (> 50%) in coverage at the daily level, decreasing with the increase in the temporal period binned. The MODIS SeaWiFS merged product is generated in essentially two steps. First, the MODIS Level-3 file is reduced in resolution from 4 to 9 km to match the global resolution of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll product. This involves combining the sum and sum squared field values for the (typically) four 4 km bins into the corresponding single 9 km bin. In the second step, the reduced-resolution MODIS file and the corresponding SeaWiFS Level-3 file are combined. Because both input files are at the same 9 km resolution, the summing is performed bin-by-bin. The Standard Mapped Image file that is generated from the merged Level-3 binned file stores scaled 16 bit integer values rather than the usual 8 bit values, giving the user much greater numerical precision. The actual images displayed on the Ocean Color website in PNG format are provided for visual inspection only.

TITLE: Marbled Murrelet Marine Density Surveys in Coastal British Columbia: Digital Dataset. ABSTRACT: This data set contains Marbled Murrelet marine density surveys (number of birds km2) at georeferenced locations along the British Columbia coast. The surveys span a period of 14 years but only include those that were conducted within the Marbled Murrelet breeding period defined as April to August. This includes the immediate pre- and post breeding period also. Because survey techniques by individual researcher may vary, all surveys are standardized to density units calculated using boat height and length surveyed. These surveys are conducted along the coast and do not include pelagic surveys. The purpose of the data set is to create a centralized inventory of Marbled Murrelet at-sea density surveys within British Columbia. This dataset is further used to build a large-scaled GIS Marbled Murrelet distribution model for coastal British Columbia..

TITLE: Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS) Traditional Reference Networks. ABSTRACT: The National Horizontal and Vertical Primary Reference Networks are traditional reference networks maintained by the Geodetic Survey Division (GSD). The Horizontal Primary Reference Network is a two-dimensional framework of interconnected control surveys with monuments spaced 20 km to 100 km apart over the entire Canadian landmass. The Vertical Primary Reference Network is an elevation framework, with bench marks established about every 2 km along major highways and railways across Canada. These networks are comprised of physically marked survey stations for which horizontal coordinates and or vertical elevations are accurately determined. In addition to the primary networks, GSD has established, and is maintaining a network of secondary surveys in Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.To provide a national framework of horizontal and vertical references, for the production of topographic maps, resource development, land administration, and scientific studies.

TITLE: Inventory and Monitoring Project, Vegetation Protocol, Denali National Park and Preserve. ABSTRACT: Purpose: The vegetation study of the Denali National Park Long Term Inventory and Monitoring project was installed in the Rock Creek drainage during the 1992-1995 growing seasons. The specific objectives are as follows: Monitor composition and structure of major plant communities in the watershed, including monitoring natural change (wildfire, flooding, climatic variation). Monitor growth rate and reproduction of the dominant treeline species, Picea glauca. Collect data compatible with long-term monitoring data sets for (1) similar plant communities and (2) white spruce growth rates and reproduction. Compare data with other sites to amplify monitoring power. Abstract: The location of the zone of transition between boreal forest and tundra, often referred to as treeline, has shifted in the past in response to climate change. Global warming is predicted to have a major effect on this ecotone within several decades, when the boreal forest will expand into areas that are now upland tundra. The vegetation changes at the northern treeline, in turn, are expected to have feedback effects on global climate through changes in carbon budgets and albedo. Accompanying changes in the rate and frequency of natural disturbances, including fire and insect outbreaks, will both cause and be caused by vegetation shifts. The vegetation in Alaska's largest national parks and preserves, including Denali, Wrangell St. Elias, Gates of the Arctic, Katmai, and Noatak, is dominated by a mix of boreal forest and upland tundra. The predicted expansion of the boreal forest into the upland tundra would have major effects on distribution and population size of the plant and animal species. Monitoring vegetation parameters that will predict and document this shift as it occurs will be a useful adjunct to monitoring of other park resources. The vegetation monitoring program of the initial phase of the Denali inventory and monitoring study was designed to focus on parameters of the boreal forest upland tundra ecotone which may help detect a response to global warming against the background of natural variation. This study appeared likely to provide the most useful information from the landscape unit selected for this study, a small watershed which crosses treeline. The treeline species i this watershed, white spruce (Picea glauca) is also the major treeline species in other Alaskan parks and throughout western North America, both currently and historically. The treeline ecotone in this watershed is particularly suitable for monitoring because the density of white spruce trees in upland areas across the elevational gradient is not limited by topography or influenced by major differences in substrate. Supplementary Information: The project protocol is based on, and data-compatible with, the well-established National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Study at the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest near Fairbanks, Alaska. Geographic Description: Rock Creek Watershed in Denali National Park and Preserve. Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central Alaska Range, approximately 210 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. Methodology: Permanent vegetation plots have been established in the following vegetation types: forest, open woodland at the tree, riparian tall shrub, alpine tundra with a variety of forbs and prostrate woody plants, and permafrost..

TITLE: CO2, Hydrographic, and Chemical Data Obtained During the R V Thomas Washington Cruise TUNES-1 in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, CDIAC NDP-062. ABSTRACT: [Summary adopted from the NDP-062 documentation] The Numeric Data Package NDP-062 consists of measurements of total carbon dioxide (TCO2), total alkalinity (TALK), and radiocarbon (delta14C), as well as hydrographic and chemical data, taken during the Research Vessel (R V) Thomas Washington Expedition TUNES-1 in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean (Section P17C). Conducted as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the cruise began in San Diego, California, on May 31, 1991, and ended in Papeete, Tahiti, on July 11, 1991. WOCE Meridional Section P17C, along 135 W and between ~5 S and 36 N, was completed during the 42-day expedition. All 123 hydrographic stations (including 9 large-volume stations) were completed to the full water-column depth. Spacing between stations was 30 nautical miles, except between 3 N and 3 S, where it was 10 nautical miles. At 30 stations, CO2 measurements were provided for the U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Program. Hydrographic and chemical measurements made along WOCE Section P17C included pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen (measured by conductivity, temperature, and depth sensor), as well as bottle measurements of salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, silicate, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-11, CFC-12, delta14C, TCO2, and TALK. In addition, potential temperatures were calculated from the measured variables. The data set is available, free of charge, as a numeric data package (NDP) from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. The NDP consists of two oceanographic data files; two FORTRAN 77 data-retrieval-routine files; a documentation file; and this printed report, which describes the contents and format of all files and the procedures and methods used to obtain the data. CDIAC has provided an anonymous FTP area to all data files, retrieval codes, and descriptive files for the NDP's that are presently available. The FTP address for the ndp062 database is: "ftp:  cdiac.esd.ornl.gov pub ndp062" and "http:  cdiac.ESD.ORNL.GOV epubs ndp ndp062 ndp062.html".

Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). MODIS Aqua processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html . SeaWiFS processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html . The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level-3 9 km merged chlorophyll products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods once the refined products for each of the contributing missions are processed. Increased coverage over the single mission product is realized through the merging of the two data sets. There is a substantial improvement (> 50%) in coverage at the daily level, decreasing with the increase in the temporal period binned. The MODIS SeaWiFS merged product is generated in essentially two steps. First, the MODIS Level-3 file is reduced in resolution from 4 to 9 km to match the global resolution of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll product. This involves combining the sum and sum squared field values for the (typically) four 4 km bins into the corresponding single 9 km bin. In the second step, the reduced-resolution MODIS file and the corresponding SeaWiFS Level-3 file are combined. Because both input files are at the same 9 km resolution, the summing is performed bin-by-bin. The Standard Mapped Image file that is generated from the merged Level-3 binned file stores scaled 16 bit integer values rather than the usual 8 bit values, giving the user much greater numerical precision. The actual images displayed on the Ocean Color website in PNG format are provided for visual inspection only.

TITLE: R. Cartographic Boundary Files, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: Cartographic Boundary Files (CBFs) contain the boundaries of standard geographic areas together with the shoreline around Canada and the larger inland lakes, all integrated in a single layer. In the second edition (released October 8, 2002), the hydrography was generalized by removing small lakes from the file to reduce noise. Large rivers emptying into the oceans were closed off, then the interior hydrography (double line river and lake polygons) was extracted to create the supplementary hydrography. The coordinates are latitude longitude and are based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The Cartographic Boundary Files for 2001 replace the Digital Cartographic Files produced for the 1996 Census. A reference guide is included (Catalogue No. 92F0171GIE).

Geographic codes provide the linkage between the statistical data and the geographic area boundaries. CBFs can also be used to create new geographic areas by aggregating standard geographic areas, and for other data manipulations available with the user's software. The CBFs are positionally consistent with the Road Network Files and Skeletal Road Network Files, which can provide additional geographic context for mapping applications.

TITLE: Baffin Island 500 Year Summer Temperature Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: Data consists of summer temperature reconstruction based on laminae thickness in sediments from Upper Soper Lake, Baffin Island, Canada. ABSTRACT (from the online documentation): Laminated sediments from Upper Soper Lake on southern Baffin Island provide a new 500-year record of temperature change in the Arctic. Radiometric dating, using 210 Pb and Pu, shows that the light- and dark-coloured laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Dark laminae thickness is strongly correlated to average June temperature from Kimmirut (r = 0.82), reflecting the influence of temperature on snowmelt and fluxes of runoff and suspended sediment. This relationship allowed the construction of a palaeotemperature record that documents large-amplitude interannual to decadal variability superimposed on distinct century-scale trends, including 2 deg C average warming and maximum temperatures during the 1900s. Similar patterns of change are seen in individual and regionally averaged palaeotemperature records from around the circum-Arctic. Upper Soper Lake records temperatures, rates of change and variance during the twentieth century that are all anomalously high within the context of the last 500 years, and outside the observed range of natural variability. Comparisons of Upper Soper Lake and Arctic average palaeotemperature to proxy-records of hypothesized forcing mechanisms suggest that the recent warming trend is mostly due to anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric greenhouse gases. The magnitude of the warming and decade-scale variability throughout the records, however, indicate that natural forcing mechanisms such as changing solar irradiance and volcanic activity, as well as positive feedbacks within the Arctic environment, also play an important role..

TITLE: Preliminary Investigation of Paleoenvironment, Processes, and Carbon Stocks of Drained Thaw-Lake Basins, Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. ABSTRACT: This data set contains measurements taken from 78 drained thaw-lake basins on the Arctic Coastal Plain between Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska. Investigators collected and analyzed sediment cores to determine soil and vegation composition, and used Landsat 7+ imagery and degree of basin polygonization to determine the relative age of the basins. Analysis of the cores included pollen, radiocarbon, and organic carbon subsampling. This project was part of an effort to determine the amount of carbon sequestered in drained basins, to determine changes in carbon accumulation rates over time, and to understand the influence of climate on the geomorphological evolution of lake basins on the Arctic Coastal Plain..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Seasonal Climatology Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Radar sounding of englacial water on Storglaciaren, Sweden. ABSTRACT: These data were acquired by a ground-based, ice-penetrating radar study of Storglaciaren in July of 2001 and 2002. Closely spaced grids were made in 4 locations using GPR at frequencies of 50 and 100 MHz. GPS measurements of the grid locations were acquired but individual radar traces are not geolocated. The purpose of this project is to understand how water is delivered from the surface of a glacier through a linked system of cavities and conduits to the bed, and the evolution of this system through time. Our research site is Storglaciaren, a polythermal glacier in Arctic Sweden. The methods we utilize are ice penetrating radar to image englacial features containing water and hot-water drilling to intersect them. A variety of down-hole instruments including bore-hole video are deployed to study the morphology of water-filled conduits. The latter activities are carried out by our co- investigators at Portland State University and the University of Stockholm. The radar portion of the project has been carried out by St. Olaf College and is the focus of this listing..

TITLE: Aerial Photography of Canada. ABSTRACT: The collection of Aerial Photography covering Canada contains over six million aerial photographs and spans over 70 years of aerial photography in Canada. Imagery from various years can be found for most areas of Canada. Our standard product is a 25cm x 25cm (10" x 10") vertical aerial photograph contact print. Most of these photographs are monochrome (black and white), but some areas are available in colour or infrared. Other products available are enlargements up to 101cm x 152cm, digital aerial photographs, transparencies, diapositives and custom mosaics. Each photo is cross-referenced to an index map or flight report that indicates the exact flight path and flight altitude, identifies film type, film number, photo centres, and specifies date, time of exposure, camera and weather conditions for that particular run. These photographs can be readily transformed into a variety of other products. Photographs are available in digital form. An on-line search and ordering system is currently being developed and will be available shortly. Aerial photography is used primarily for mapping purposes; however, it also has many other applications such as urban and rural planning, environmental impact studies, civil law cases, real estate evaluation, outdoor recreation and even as wall art.

TITLE: Daily Precipitation Sums at Coastal and Island Russian Arctic Stations, 1940-1990. ABSTRACT: This data set contains precipitation data originally recorded in log books at 65 coastal and island meteorological stations, and later digitized at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia, under the direction of Vladimir Radionov. Records from most stations begin in 1940. Instrumentation was generally a rain gauge with Nipher shield until the early 1950s (for most stations), when the Tretyakov precipitation gauge replaced earlier instrumentation. Data have not been adjusted for gauge type or wind bias. Observers corrected the data from 1967-1990 for wetting loss as they recorded the station data..

TITLE: Landslides, Set 1. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: This set of slides graphically illustrates the potential danger that major earthquakes pose to school structures and to the children and adults who happen to be inside at the time of the earthquake. It includes pictures from 1886 to 1988. The slide set includes nine destructive earthquakes that occurred in the U.S. and eight earthquakes that occurred in foreign countries. The slopes above streams and rivers are subjected to a variety of processes that cause them to recede and retreat from the river or stream channel. These processes, collectively called mass wasting, can be classified according to rapidity of movement and according to the type of materials that are transported. Gravity is the force behind all such downslope movement. Factors that enable the force of gravity to overcome the resistance of inertia and friction to move more material downslope include: saturation by water which acts as a lubricant, steepening of slopes by streams, waves, or road construction, alternate freezing and thawing, and earthquake vibrations. Mass wasting of surface material is widespread process that can be found in high mountains, desert hillsides, deep ocean shelves, steep ocean shores and even on the moon and other rocky planets. The major methods of mass movement include: Rockfalls: Large or small amounts of rock material break away from the face of a cliff as a result of weathering, and in the most rapid type of mass movement, free fall or bounce along an irregular slope to the base of the cliff forming talus. Rockslide: Rock material slides along a plane of structural weakness such as a bedding plane. Although they are most common on steep slopes, they can even occur on slopes of 15 degrees. Millions of tons of rock may plunge down slope at speeds greater than 160 km (100 miles per hour in what is often the most catastrophic form of mass wasting. Debris slide: Dry to moderately-wet, loose rock fragments and soil move rapidly over the surface of underlying bedrock. The interface of moving material and undrlying bedrock is dry in a debris slide. Debris avalanche: Loose earth on a steep slope becomes wet and slides to the bottom of the slope. Snow avalanche: Unstable snow breaks loose and plunges down slope carrying rock and debris, carving avalanche chutes. Debris flow: Rock fragments, mud, and water flow downslope as a thick viscous fluid. Debris flows may begin as slumps and continue as flows. Movement may be as slow as that of freshly poured concrete or as rapid as that of a river. Mudflow: Silt and clay particles with water content as high as thirty percent follow stream valleys until the terrain flattens. Then they spread out as fans. Mudflows are sometimes over 100 m (330 ft) thick; they can float large boulders and move houses from their foundations. The speed of movement depends on the slope and the water content of the flow. Landslide: Unconsolidated rock material and even the bedrock itself may be involved in what is usually a rapid movement of material beginning with the slumping of stream banks or sea cliffs, or the sliding of mountain sides. Landslides move as a unit or series of units along a definite plane (in contrast to debris flows which move as viscous fluids). The material moves downward and outward along a curved plane. Eventually the material breaks into fragments that slide over uneven ground at the base until friction overcomes the force of motion. Slumping: A resistant rock overlies a weaker rock layer. The weaker rock is eroded undermining the resistant rock and producing an unstable condition. Slump blocks can be as much as 5 km (3 mi) long and 150 m (495 ft) thick. They may move in a matter of seconds or gradually slip over a period of several weeks. SolifluctionThe upper zone of saturated soil flows slowly down even the most gentle slopes in arctic and subarctic regions where an impermeable permafrost area exists. Water can not percolate into this permafrost area so the thawed surface remains saturated and flows as a viscous fluid.Rock GlacierAngular rock debris resembling glaciers move as a body down slope at rates ranging from 3 cm (1.2 in) a day to 1 m (3.3 ft) a year. A considerable amount of ice exists in the pore spaces between the rock fragments and is responsible for much of the movement. The increased weight of rock fragments falling onto the flow cause the ice to flow. Steep cliffs and a cold climate that keeps ice permanently frozen are conditions that most often result in rock glaciers. A steep flow front, lobes, and concentric ridges on the flow are evidence of rock glaciers.CreepThe mantle on a slope moves downward almost imperceptibly under the constant pull of gravity. In areas subject to cold winters the water in the layers of soil or clay freezes and increases in volume. This lifts the rocks upward at right angles to the slope. However, when melting occurs the rocks fall vertically and so are moved downhill. Wetting and drying has the same effect since moisture causes expansion of clay materials. Burrowing organisms displace particles permitting the force of gravity to move them. Growing plant roots and the tramping of animals also force soil material downslope.

TITLE: Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Collected by the NOAA CMDL Flask Sampling Network. ABSTRACT: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) has collected chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flask samples and in situ instruments located at monitoring stations. The Halocarbons and other Trace Species Group (HATS) of NOAA CMDL collects measurements for a standard suite of Radiatively Important Trace Species (RITS): CFC-12, CFC-11, CFC-113 (1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane), methyl chloroform (MC), carbon tetrachloride (CT) and nitrous oxide (N2O). NOAA CMDL HATS stations are at Point Barrow, Alaska (BRW); Mauna Loa, Hawaii (MLO); Cape Matatula, American Samoa (SMO); and, South Pole, Antarctica (SPO). Cooperative stations are at Niwot Ridge, Colorado (NWT); Alert, Canada (ALT); and Cape Grim, Australia (CGO). Starting in 1977, paired samples were collected each week in electropolished stainless steel flasks at the four NOAA CMDL HATS sites and Niwot Ridge. After 1980, flask pairs at South Pole were collected once a week. Collection of flask pairs at Alert bagan in 1988 and at Cape Grim in 1991. All flasks were shipped back to NOAA CMDL in Boulder, CO for analysis by electron capture gas chromatography (EC-GC). In 1987 the flask sample program was complemented by automated in situ measurements at the four NOAA CMDL HATS sites and Niwot Ridge. Principal investigators for the CFC-11 and CFC-12 in situ and flask measurements are: J. Elkins, T. Thompson, and J. Butler (NOAA CMDL) Principal investigators for the CFC-113 flask measurements are: S. Montzaka, J. Elkins, and J.

TITLE: Surface exposure ages from Hjorth Hill, McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: This data base contains information on cosmogenic helium-3 and beryllium-10 surface exposure dates on Ross Sea Drift moraine boulders from Hjorth Hill, McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (77 degrees 31' South, 163 degrees 37' East). This study was designed to combine surficial ages with a Ground Penetrating Radar data set generated by Dr. M. Prentice at the University of New Hampshire. Surface exposure dating relies on the build-up of cosmogenic nuclides in materials exposured to cosmic radiation. Because cosmogenic rays only penetrate 2 m in rock, freshly eroded glacial debris only begins accumulating cosmogenic nuclides after deposition from the glacier. When production rates are known the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in moraine boulders can be used to date formation of end moraines and drift sheets. The samples were collected by M.D. Kurz and R. Ackert and colleagues during the 1990 and 1992 field seasons. The samples are archived at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The ages, provided below in the table, provide age constraints on this important record of past fluctuations of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

TITLE: Coastal Ocean Radar (CODAR) Site Locations. ABSTRACT: CODAR is used to measure the surface currents of the coastal ocean. A transmitter sends out a radio frequency that bounces off the ocean surface and back to areceiver antenna. Using this information and the principles of the Doppler shift, CODAR is able to calculate the speed and direction of the surface current. These calculations are made at about every half mile across the surface and extend as far as about twenty miles offshore. Detailed pictures are available for the following CODAR sites: Site 1: Brant Beach, New Jersey Site 2: Brigantine, New Jersey Central Site: Tuckerton, New Jersey Shack Interior: Instrument Box Antennas (Receiver and Transmitter).

TITLE: Marine Sediment Geochemistry Data (Solid Phase), Global Locations. ABSTRACT: This dataset consists of chemical analyses of metal concentrations and carbon contents of marine sediments (cores and grab samples) collected during research cruises conducted by, or for, the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) at more than 35 field study locations around the world. The concentrations of most metals are based on partial acid digestions of sediment samples; however, some analyses of "total" metal contents are also included.Chemical analyses of metal concentrations and organic carbon contents in marine sediments are used for many different purposes. Scientists at GSC-Atlantic have examined the spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of metals and carbon in marine sediments to study the effects of both natural (e.g. variations in bedrock geology) and man-made (e.g. ocean dumping) phenomena. For example, these data have been used to study the effects of pollution (from sewage, smelter emissions, aquaculture, etc.) on coastal ecosystems, and have been used to track the dispersion of contaminants by oceanographic processes. Other studies have focused on understanding the natural processes that influence the distribution of metals in the sediment column after deposition, which are collectively referred to as diagenesis. The methods used for collecting, processing, and analyzing sediment samples have varied widely over time, and are generally tailored to meet the scientific objectives of individual research cruises.

TITLE: T. Population Ecumene Census Division Boundary File, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The Population Ecumene Census Division Boundary File contains a generalized population ecumene based on 2001 Census population density data with at least one ecumene polygon for every census division. When ecumene boundaries are used for dot and choropleth mapping, they give a more accurate depiction of the spatial distribution of data within standard geographic areas. The Population Ecumene Census Division Boundary File is available as a standard package for Canada free on the Internet or it can be purchased on CD-ROM through the nearest regional reference centre. This file is not a Cartographic Boundary File and it has its own reference guide (92F0159GIE). Coordinates: Latitude longitude (NAD83). Format: ARC INFO Interchange, and MapInfo Interchange for Windows. Catalogue number for the Internet is: 92F0159XIE01000 Catalogue number for CD-ROM is: 92F0159XCE01000 ...for more information visit our organization's web site.The population ecumene is disseminated to enable users to thematically map census division data. It enables users to display data where population is concentrated (where there are ecumene pockets) in Canada.

TITLE: HANPP Collection: Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (HANPP) by Country and Product. ABSTRACT: The Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (HANPP) by Country and Product portion of the HANPP Collection contains tabular data on carbon-equivalents of consumption by country and by type of product. The data were compiled from national-level FAO statistics on consumption of products such as vegetables, meat, paper, and wood. HANPP represents the amount of carbon required to derive food and fibre products consumed by humans including organic matter that is lost during harvesting and processing. Net primary productivity (NPP), the net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesis, can be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world's ecosystems. These tabular data were used to allocate country level NPP consumption to a spatial surface of NPP consumption (Global Patterns in Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity), which is part of this collection. This dataset is distributed by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). The purpose is to provide online access to tabular data on human appropriation of net primary productivity. The data are available from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) in Microsoft Excel (XLS) format via direct download at http:  sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu es hanpp.html..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Measurements of the tide level, current, temperature and salinity of McMurdo Sound and examination of the biological biomass in the water column. ABSTRACT: A measurement of the tides and currents in McMurdo Sound was conducted over several seasons. Current measurements were first made in McMurdo Sound by Hodgson (1907) during the stay of the Discovery in Winter Quarters Bay in 1902-1903. Further measurements were made in the 1950s with the establishment of both McMurdo Station and Scott Base. Current measurements made in the late 1950s and early 1960s are described in Tressler and Ommundsen, 1962, Gilmour et al., 1962, Gilmour, 1963 and Littlepage, 1965. In the 1970-71 field season, a tide gauge was established at McMurdo Station on the rock pier built for the inlet and outlet to the nuclear power plant at the time. Six weeks of records were obtained from this gauge. Holes were drilled in the fast ice and measurements were made of the current, standard temperature and salinity measurements. Biological hauls with a plankton net were made over one period of 25 hours and several periods of about 8 hours from up to 6 holes at various locations. The biomass of each sample was measured. Biological samples and hydrological casts were also made from a ship from the ice channel adjacent to Arrival Heights. In the 1972-73 field season, a line of five hydrographic stations extending 16 miles west from Cape Armitage were used to make measurements of current observations at 100m intervals with observation periods separated by several days. This line of stations covered the major part of the cross section available for flux through the open ended Sound and it was hoped that new information on the circulation, particularly the tidal circulation in McMurdo would be reached. In the 1973-74 field season, a tide gauge was installed at the de-salinisation plant outfall at McMurdo and a current meter was installed through a hole in the ice about 2 miles west of Cape Armitage.

TITLE: AVHRR Leads-ARI Polar Gridded Brightness Temperatures. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of AVHRR imagery selected from hard copy 'quick look' images to provide the best coverage possible over the Arctic approximately every three days for a three-year period. Level 1B data from NOAA SDSD have been calibrated and mapped to earth locations, then gridded (1 km pixels) on a basin scale to the polar stereographic projection. The projection is similar to that used by NSIDC to produce DMSP SSM I polar brightness temperature and sea ice products. Each image was ranked for areal coverage of particular seas and for degree of cloud coverage. Passes covering a large area are generally favored over shorter passes with less cloud cover. The data set was developed in support of the Office Of Naval Research Arctic Leads Accelerated Research Initiative (Arctic Leads ARI). The aim of the Initiative was to develop a more thorough understanding of the oceanography, meteorology, and ice dynamics surrounding formation and evolution of leads in sea ice. The leads ARI field experiment took place from March to April 1992. A spreadsheet containing the image rankings is available in hard copy (NOARL Tech. Note 118, April 1991); paper copies of the spreadsheet are available on request. Data set information is available on-line. Data are available on 8mm tape or selected images dates via ftp..

TITLE: Dissolved Al in the Southern Ocean. ABSTRACT: Sampling and Analytical Methodology: Samples were taken using 24 internally Teflon-coated PVC 12 litre GO-FLO Samplers (General Oceanics Inc.) mounted on an all-titanium frame (De Baar et al., 2008). This frame was connected to a 17.7 mm diameter Kevlar hydrowire with seven independent internal signal conductor cables (Cousin Trestec S.A.) and controlled from onboard. Each GO-FLO sampler had a special ultraclean all-teflon PTFE valve (Cole Parmer; PN A-06392-31) installed. Samples for trace metal analysis were collected from the GO-FLO bottles in a class 100 clean room environment. The water was filtered over a 0.2 μm filter cartridge (Sartrobran-300, Sartorius) under pressure (1.5 atm) of (in-line prefiltered) nitrogen gas exerted via a special connector instead of the regular air bleeding valve at the top of each GO-FLO sampler. Sub-samples for Al were taken in cleaned LDPE sample bottles (125 mL) from each GO-FLO bottle. All sample bottles were rinsed five times with the sample seawater. The analyses of dissolved Al were performed on shipboard after the method developed by Resing and Measures (1994) with improvements by Brown and Bruland (2008). This method is a flow injection analysis, based on the fluorescence from the reaction between lumogallion and Al. Samples were stored in a refrigerator (4°C) and analysed usually within 24 h after sampling but always within 36 h. Samples were acidified at least 1 h before analysis with 12 M ultraclean HCl (Baseline® Hydrochloric Acid, Seastar Chemicals Inc.) to a pH of 1.8. In the flow injection system the samples were buffered inline to a pH of 5.5 ± 0.1 with ultraclean 2 M ammonium acetate buffer. This buffer was produced after Aguilar-Islas et al. (2006) by diluting a saturated solution of ammonium acetate crystals to a 2 M solution with MQ (Millipore Milli-Q deionised water R > 18.2 MΩ cm-1). The pH was subsequently adjusted to be between 8.8 and 8.9 with ultraclean ammonium hydroxide. The latter was produced by bubbling 0.2 µm filtered high purity ammonia gas through MQ water. The buffered sample was pre-concentrated during 200 s on a Toyopearl AF-Chelate 650M (TosoHaas, Germany) column. Hereafter the column was rinsed for 60 s with MQ water to remove interfering salts. The Al was subsequently eluted from the column with 0.16 M HCl (Suprapure, Merck) during 250 s. The eluate of Al in HCl entered the reaction stream which consisted of a lumogallion (Pfaltz & Bauer) solution in 4 M ammonium acetate buffer. The 4 M buffer was produced similar to the 2 M buffer (see above), but with the pH adjusted to be between 6.4 and 6.5 and the lumogallion was a 4.8 mM solution in MQ. The mixing of the HCl and the buffer results in a reaction pH between 5.3 and 5.4 at which an Al-Lumogallion chelate complex is formed which can be detected by its fluorescence. The complex was mixed in a 10 m reaction coil placed in a water bath of 50 °C. Hereafter a 5% Brij-35 (Merck) solution in MQ was added to increase the sensitivity (Resing and Measures, 1994) and mixed in a 3 m length mixing coil. Afterwards the emission of the fluorescent complex was detected on a FIA-lab PMT-FL detector with a 510 until 580 nm emission filter and a 480 until 490 nm excitation filter. Concentrations of Al were calculated in nanomol•L-1 (nM) from the peak heights. The system was calibrated using standard additions from a 5000 nM Al stock solution (Fluka) to filtered acidified seawater of low (<0.5 nM) Al concentration that was collected in the Antarctic Ocean. A six-point calibration line (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 nM Al standard additions) and blank determination were made every day. The 3 lowest points (0, 1 and 2 nM Al standard additions) of the calibration line were measured in triplicate and the 3 highest points (4, 6 and 8 nM Al standard additions) in duplicate in order to add more weight to the lower part of the calibration line. The blank was determined by plotting the signals of increasing pre-concentration times (30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 seconds) of the filtered acidified seawater of low (<0.5 nM) Al concentration also used for the calibration. A line was fitted through these data points and the intercept of the line taken as the blank, which was usually below 0.2 nM Al. The latter value of 0.2 nM was also the maximum allowed blank before starting a series of analyses. The limit of detection, defined as three times the standard deviation of the lowest concentration observed, was 0.07 nM. The flow injection system was cleaned every day by rinsing with a 0.5 M HCl solution. Data Processing: A standard was measured in triplicate every day. This standard was a sub-sample of a 25 L volume of filtered seawater that was taken at the beginning of the cruise in the South East Atlantic Ocean. The relative standard deviation of the replicate analysis seawater sample that was analysed 36 times on different days in triplicate was 3.16%. The relative standard deviation on single days was on average 1.5%. The average concentration of Al of this standard was 3.56 nM and the deviation from this average for a given measuring day was used as a correction factor. To verify whether this correction was decreasing the inter-daily variability in the dataset, every day a sample which was collected and measured the previous measuring day, was analysed once again. The deviation between the concentrations measured on the different days decreased from 4.8% to 3.5%, indicating the data correction is beneficial. As an independent comparison, the certification samples collected on the American SAFe cruise (Johnson et al., 2007) were analysed in triplicate for Al. The resulting concentrations of Al for both SAFe Surface (S) and SAFe deep (D2) from 1000 m, agreed very nicely the community consensus value on the absolute concentrations of Mn in the SAFe samples. The dataset was scanned for obvious outliers and these have been quality flagged with the number 4. Some samples gave anomalous nutrient results for the intended depth and were assumed to have been closed at the wrong depth and quality flagged with the number 8. All other values are assumed to be correct and flagged with the number 0..

TITLE: Macro and megabenthic communities in the High Arctic Basin: Initial Findings. ABSTRACT: This dataset investigates the macro- and megabenthos of the Canada Basin, which is one of the biologically least known areas of the Arctic deep sea. Macro-infauna was collected with 11 box cores at six stations ranging from 640 to 3,250 m water depth. Total abundance ranged from 3 to 265 individuals 0.04 square meters (75 - 6,625 individuals per square meters) and decreased with increasing depth. Biomass ranged from 0.04 to 228 mg wet weight 0.04 square meters and followed the same trend. Polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves dominated the faunal densities, biomass and species numbers. A total of 90 benthic invertebrate species taxa (including 15 identified from under-water imager), not part of this data set) from four biogeographic affinities were identified, including at least three new species of Isopoda. The evident low abundances and biomass are in agreement with findings from the Eurasian Arctic deep sea. This dataset exist in Excel format, and presents the foundation for a scientific publication by Bluhm et al (2005). The purpose of the dataset is to assess species composition, abundance and distribution of the infauna of the Arctic Canada Basin..

TITLE: Colonial Waterbird Inventory and Monitoring Program. ABSTRACT: Purpose: 1. Regulatory agencies need to have data on colony or roost site locations and feeding areas to assist them in making decisions about protection and or acquisition. 2. State, Federal, and NGO groups need to know status and trends of selected populations of waterbirds at local, regional, and national scales. 3. Waterbird monitoring may provide useful "bioindication" of changes in wetland habitats over time 4. Waterbirds are an important recreational resource (e.g. bird watchers) and are often used as symbols for conservation (e.g., National Audubon Society logo, Maryland's Chesapeake Bay commemorative license plate). Thus, their status is often quite conspicuous. Abstract: Since the demise of the Colonial Bird Register at Cornell University, no national colonial waterbird population database currently exists. Planning is underway (both in USGS, Biological Resources Division and the US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS)) to develop a monitoring program. Feedback on a data form has been solicited from a number of states and many have responded. We now have a set of "core fields" that have been agreed upon; these represent the minimum set that is felt to be necessary to determine status and trends, including: (1) colony site location and name, (2) general nesting habitat description and use, (3) census methods, and dates, and (4) population size of each species. Given the various types of software and hardware in use in different states, the most effective way to centralize the data would be to have contributing agencies provide an exported data file and description of the data fields. The location of the centralized database is expected to be the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. The planning at this point includes an analysis by state, region, and nation of each species, similar to what the Breeding Bird Survey does annually. Of course, publication and privacy rights of the contributed data will need to be addressed. We may use the Bird Banding Laboratory as a model for this. RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL FOR A REGIONAL NATIONAL COLONIAL WATERBIRD INVENTORY & MONITORING PROGRAM A number of meetings and workshops have been held in recent years to address inventories of waterbirds and their habitats. With the initiation of the new Biological Resources Division of USGS, a new emphasis is being placed on inventory and monitoring of our national biological resources. Coupled with this is a realization that, to be effective, partnerships among state, federal, and non- governmental organizations (NGO) are necessary to complete these large tasks. Because they are top carnivores in the food web and many species are strongly tied to wetlands, waterbirds are consistently identified as an important wildlife component to monitor. Wetlands are often identified at state and federal levels as habitats that are in the greatest jeopardy. Supplementary Information: There is a lot of regional and species variation in the timing of nesting. In the north (ca. 36 N latitude), the nesting inventories should be focused between 1 June and 25 June. In the south, this same period should also apply to the ground-nesters, but for wading birds, at least two visits are probably necessary, one in March, the other in late May-early June. In Florida, with year-round nesting, 3-4 estimates may be necessary to include all species. If at all possible, all colonies in the south should be visited at least twice. Visits should be spaced at least a month apart. Most agencies cannot afford a large-scale inventory of all colonies on an annual basis. Given that, a number of alternatives are possible (see Erwin et al. 1984 Proc. Workshop on Manage. of Nongame Species and Ecol. Commun., Univ. of Kentucky). Assuming funding limitations. our recommendation is as follows: 1.Monitor ground-nesting species (gulls, terns, skimmers, cormorants, pelicans) every 4 years. For species of special concern (endangered, etc.), the major colonies should be censused annually. 2.Monitor tree-nesting (wading birds) every 4 years, the year following the ground-nesting inventory. Annual counts for major colonies of selected species (e.g. Wood Storks). The scheduling should be kept consistent among regions to insure that "metapopulations" are sampled at the same time. If schedules differ among states, interpretation of trends over regions becomes problematic. For example, some data exist to show that Roseate, Common and Least Terns move among colonies in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Thus, New York (Long Island) and southern New England states should form a regional unit when censusing. Other areas form natural units, such as Chesapeake Bay (Maryland and Virginia) and western Gulf of Mexico (Texas-Louisiana). Geographic Description: Focusing on coastal areas, starting with Great Lakes, Atlantic, Gulf and West Coast, not Alaska. Methodology: Predominantly ground census methods used, limited aerial census methods. Many papers have been published regarding census methods for seabirds, fewer for wading birds. It is widely recognized that the total number of breeding pairs at a colony in a given breeding season is the desired value to be estimated. This value is often elusive because of the non-synchronous breeding of many species at a colony (e.g., tropical populations are much more protracted than are arctic populations in nesting), the crypticity of nests (e.g. crevices), or sometimes simply the large size of the colony. The desire to achieve accuracy may come at the cost of disturbance. Bibby et al. (1992, Bird Census Techniques, Academic Press Ltd) for instance recommend plot sample methods but caution investigators to limit visits to a tern colony to 20 min. We present our recommendations for censusing various groups, keeping in mind that cost and time are usually limiting factors for most states. Most of this information has been published previously (Erwin 1979 USFWS OBS publ., Erwin 1985 Trans. NE Fish & Wildl. Conf.). 1.Alcids, petrels, and "true seabirds" - Because they are represented in only a small number of states, the reader is referred directly to Nettleship (1976), Birkhead and Nettleship (1980), and Bibby et al. (1992). In most cases, monitoring small plots for nests is recommended, with densities then extrapolated to the entire colony area to estimate breeding populations. 2.Gulls - Colonies can be located easily by fixed-wing aircraft and estimates of small colonies (<300) can be made from the air where the habitat is fairly open. For larger colonies, ground estimates can be made relatively rapidly by having several counters flushing nesting birds while walking through the colony. The total number of gulls estimated in the air can then be used as a rough estimate of "nesting pairs" since, during the day, roughly one adult is present per nest (Erwin l979). If more detailed data are desired at any colonies, plots ranging to 20 X 20 m may be desirable, depending on the nest density (Bibby et al. 1992). Mark-recapture methods (Lincoln-Peterson) can also be used to estimate the accuracy of the nest counts (Erwin l979). 3.Cormorants - Because they are black and produce a white guano background, cormorants can be easily photographed from fixed wing aircraft with a 35 mm B&W film camera. If aircraft are not available, conducting a ground count can be done either by estimating numbers flushing from the ground (or trees), or by estimating the number of birds after they land in the water near the colony. Because they fly in lines, they are easier to estimate than many other seabirds. 4.Terns, Brown Pelicans, and Black Skimmers - Some species such as the large Royal and Sandwich Tern can be counted from aerial photos, along with skimmers. However, not all sites are nesting colonies; sometimes skimmers roost on sites that appear to be colonies from aircraft. Therefore, we recommend ground estimates of large colonies (>200) and direct nest counts for smaller colonies. Because the large terns and Brown Pelicans nest on the ground in the open, counts of incubating birds can often be made from a vehicle or on foot using a scope. This has the advantage of avoiding disturbance and egg loss to avian predators such as Fish Crows. For the small and intermediate-size terns, we recommend using the adult estimate as the estimated number of breeding pairs, since most attempts to correlate numbers of nests and adults converge at about 1.0, although there may be variation by time of day, season, or colony. For Least Terns and Gull-billed Terns, colonies are usually small and nesting can often be protracted through the season. Direct nest counts should be attempted and 2-3 visits may be necessary from June into July. Using the 1:1 adult to nest ration usually still holds. Arguing over the appropriate "correction factors" is probably a minor source of variation in the overall program. Consistency, especially within each state, is the most important element in any monitoring program. 5.Wading birds a. Great Blue Herons - Because they are so widespread, they are a species being monitored at a number of locations. We recommend nest counts from photographs in the early Spring before leaves come out in the northern parts of the U.S. (early to mid-April). Ground counts can also be done with more difficulty. Nest trees should be individually marked and numbers of nests recorded. This should be done after the young begin to hatch, both to help locate nests from the debris on the ground near the trees, and to reduce disturbance at the site. b. Wood Storks - Because of their Endangered status, effort should be made to estimate rather precisely the number of nests in a colony. This can sometimes be done from fixed-wing aircraft, but usually ground censuses are needed. Because storks depend on water level conditions, colonies may shift; therefore, extensive surveying may be needed using a stratified random survey design. Simply returning to previously-used sites may result in a bias in trends. c. Mixed heronries of intermediate-sized herons - Most heronries have several or more species. Because the eggs of many species are indistinguishable, estimating exact numbers of nests can be difficult. We recommend that, for small heronries (<100 nests), a nest count be attempted but time limited to 30 min. To "assign" the nests to different species in a mixed colony, estimate the number of each species flushing from the colony. For larger colonies, we recommend that several censusers enter the colony to flush birds, while 2 or more observers remain outside to estimate numbers by species. It may be necessary to divide up the species by observer. We recommend estimating Black-crowned Night-Herons and ibises first, since these are the first to flush from the colony. On average, we estimate one adult equals one nest for most wader species. 6.General Comments - If a state is so large that a complete inventory cannot be achieved in a given year, it is best to conduct a census of the large colonies at a minimum. Because some of the site dynamics will be lost, we recommend that 2-3 other areas (e.g. counties) be thoroughly censused to determine the degree of site turnover (Erwin et al. 1984, Erwin 1985). These could even be done in years other than the one devoted to the large-colony effort. The comment highlighted above under Wood Storks needs to be reiterated: simply returning year after year to previously occupied sites leads to a dangerous bias. A carefully developed survey is needed to identify new sites that may develop as well as revisiting old sites. Census techniques.

TITLE: Global GPS Satellite Clock Corrections. ABSTRACT: GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite clock corrections are computed from observational data and final GPS satellite ephemerides and are typically available 3 to 6 days after the observations are made. The clock corrections can be applied to pseudo-range (code) measurements from a single receiver and can obtain positioning accuracy at the one metre level depending on the GPS receiver characteristics. The corrections are archived in ASCII format at 30-second intervals and can be interpolated (e.g. one second data) without degrading positioning accuracies.Used with the GPSPACE GPS point positioning program and the Precise GPS Satellite Ephemerides, to provide Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) accuracies without requiring base station data.

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Experiment (AOE) Model Forcing and Data for the GEWEX Cloud System Study Data Integration for Model Evaluation (GCSS-DIME). ABSTRACT: The Arctic Ocean Experiment (AOE) 2001 was a multi-disciplinary program sponsored by the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat in collaboration with several other institutions including the Stockholm University and the NOAA&#039;s Environmental Technologies Laboratory in Boulder Colorado. During a 2-1 2 month period beginning in late-June, 2001, the Swedish Maritime Administration Icebreaker Oden became the host platform for scientists and support personnel from 13 different countries working in the fields of Oceanography, Geology, Ice and Aerosol Physics, Marine Biology, Atmospheric Chemistry and Meteorology. The principal goal of the Atmospheric Program was to enhance understanding about how natural sources of atmospheric aerosols affect climate through impact on the radiation balance. This case study presents data from 5 July 2001 to 26 Aug 2001 and covers a region from 80N to 90N latitude and from 15W to 15E longitude. The data for this experiment is under Working Group 5 (Polar Clouds) of the GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS) is to improve the parameterization of precipitating convective cloud systems in global climate models (GCMs) and numerical weather prediction models through an improved physical understanding of cloud system processes..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 1A Global Area Coverage (GAC), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Merged LAC (MLAC) Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global satellite measurements by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS acquires approximately 15 pole-to-pole orbital swaths of data per day, and approximately 90% of the ocean surface is scanned every two days. SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The OBPG first processes SeaWiFS Level 0 to Level 1A using l1a_gen, by appending calibration data, navigation data, instrument telemetry information, and selected spacecraft telemetry information to form a Level 1A HDF file that contains raw radiance values for each of the eight SeaWiFS bands. The input Level 0 data used to produce the Level 1A can be of two spatial resolutions - either LAC (Local Area Coverage), which is 1.1 km at nadir, or GAC (Global Area Coverage), which is 1.1 km resolution but with pixels spaced at 4.4km intervals. Four types of Level 1 SeaWiFS data are processed by OBPG: GAC, LAC, HRPT, and MLAC. Of the Level 1 SeaWiFS data, only GAC and MLAC data are distributed via the Ocean Color Web. The Level 1A Global Area Coverage (GAC) product consists of radiance data for all 8 SeaWiFS bands, subsampled at 4.5 km resolution. A single file consists of all the scans in a north-to-south swath (Arctic to Antarctic). The average file size for a single level 1A GAC file is 19.1 MB, with approximately 14 swaths obtained per day. The Level 1A Local Area Coverage (LAC) product consists of radiance data at 1.1 km resolution and is intended for calibration and validation of the sensor and to obtain high resolution data for areas of special interest. The Level 1A High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) product consists of all the data collected at a given High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) ground station during a single overpass. SeaWiFS broadcasts direct downlink data at 1 kilometer resolution. The approximate size of each file is 35 MB, with most stations obtaining two overpasses per day. The Level 1A Merged LAC (MLAC) product contains all available SeaWiFS HRPT and LAC data for a given orbit. This is done by consolidating all SeaWiFS 1-km-resolution data which have been collected by various HRPT stations, as well as the LAC data recorded onboard the spacecraft into Level 1A files on a per orbit basis. Level-1A or Level-2 MLAC data is identical in format to SeaWiFS LAC and HRPT, except that the scan times may be discontinuous due to gaps in the HRPT LAC geographic coverage. For MLAC data, each product contains the best available full-resolution data for a single orbit, without duplication.

TITLE: Geochemical Ocean Section Study (GEOSECS) Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Mediterranean Radiocarbon Data, CDIAC NDP-027. ABSTRACT: This package contains radiocarbon data from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans obtained during the Geochemical Ocean Section Study (GEOSECS). GEOSECS, initiated in 1971 and coordinated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was designed to establish a baseline data base for assessing future chemical changes in the world's oceans and to provide a better understanding of large-scale oceanic transport and mixing processes. During the GEOSECS expeditions, over 2,200 water samples were collected. Samples for carbon-14 were collected at 124 stations, and approximately 18 samples were collected at each station from intervals throughout the water column. The sampling technique and measurement procedure used in the radiocarbon determinations is described in Stuiver et al. (1974). On board the ship, the samples for radiocarbon were water drawn from 270-liter Gerard barrels, and CO2 was extracted following a method derived from Fonselius and Ostlund (1959). The CO2 samples were absorbed in excess NaOH, deposited in well-sealed bottles and sent to laboratories for processing. Delta 14C values are recalculated to a standardized state of isotopic fractionation equivalent to standard wood (del 13C = -25 permil) and are related to activities at the time of sampling. All the radiocarbon, hydrographic, and position data presented in this package have been provided by the Oceanographic Data Facility at Scripps. Data included in this package include the following: position (degrees and minutes), sample number, depth (in meters calculated from density and pressure), potential temperature, salinity, and delta 14C determinations from the University of Miami and the University of Washington. The GEOSECS radiocarbon data were used to establish the gross rate of deep-ocean circulation. Stuiver et al. (1983) summarized these data and concluded that replacement times of the waters below 1,500 meters in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans are, respectively, about 275, 250, and 510 years. These radiocarbon data also reflect the general trend of deep circulation from the Atlantic to the other oceans and are of value in establishing parameters in multidimensional ocean models. All CDIAC numerical data packages include copies of pertinent literature discussing the data, summaries discussing the background, source and scope of the data, as well as applications limitations and restrictions of the data.

TITLE: AFI 02 30_01 - The status of dark septate fungi in Antarctic plant and soil communities - Fungal cultures, plant and soil samples (live and frozen) collected from the northern Antarctic Peninsula region in 2002 2003. ABSTRACT: Three plant species, the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians and the angiosperms Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, were sampled from 12 islands across a 1480 km latitudinal gradient from South Georgia through to Adelaide Island. Samples were collected to determine the abundance of dark septate fungi in Antarctic plant and soil communities and the effects of these organisms on plant growth. Where the target species were found in sufficient numbers to allow sampling, it proved possible to collect at least 10 samples of each species. At least 10 soil samples were collected from each site where Deschampsia was found. Plants, with intact roots and soil, were transported back to the UK using cool and frozen stowage. Additionally, intact live plants were transported to the UK in an illuminated cabinet. Seeds of the two key species (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) were also collected at Bird Island and South Georgia. As the exact months of the data collection were not provided, and the metadata standard requires a YYYY-MM-DD format, this dataset has been dated as 1st January for start date, and 31st December for stop date..

TITLE: Ice Thickness and Surface Elevation, Southeastern Ross Embayment, West Antarctica. ABSTRACT: Ice surface elevation and ice thickness data are available for a portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The investigators utilized a laser altimeter and ice-penetrating radar mounted to a Twin Otter aircraft to survey the ice sheet. Ice surface elevations and ice thickness data, derived from laser altimetry and radar sounding results, are available in ASCII format via ftp. These data are a result of the Corridor Aerogeophysics of the Southeastern Ross Transect Zone (CASERTZ) experiments of the 1990s. The CASERTZ geophysical surveys were aimed at understanding geological controls on ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, ultimately to help assess the potential for ice sheet collapse. Blankenship et al. (2001) used ice surface elevations and ice thicknesses (reported here) to calculate driving stresses across the ice sheet and thus to identify regions of rapid basal movement by ice streams..

TITLE: NSCAT scatterometer global 25km sigma-0 and ocean winds (Dunbar); Product #084. ABSTRACT: This product provides two data sets from NSCAT, the NASA Scatterometer. The two data sets in this product are the Earth-located radar backscatter (sigma-0), and vector wind measurements, collocated in 25 km x 25 km wind vector cells. The selected wind vector is flagged. Backscatter measurements are provided globally over land, ice and oceans. The derived wind vector solutions (all ambiguities) and the selected wind vector are only available over oceans. The data are organized in a swath-based format, with each record consisting of a cross-track row of 48 wind vector cells (24 on each side of the satellite subtrack). Each record contain a number of variables, sigma-0's and related information, such that investigators can re-retrieve the winds using their own model function should they wish. Each file covers one NSCAT revolution and typically consists of 1624 data records. This product is also referred to as the 'high resolution merged geophysical data product'. This is the only NSCAT data product that contains global sigma-0 data..

TITLE: Monthly average polar sea-ice concentration. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this data set is to provide paleoclimate researchers with a tool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea-ice concentration in the modern polar oceans and for estimating the modern monthly sea-ice concentration at any given polar oceanic location. It is expected that these data will be compared with paleoclimate data derived from geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable-isotope analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general circulation models of climate change. This data set represents the results of calculations carried out on sea-ice-concentration data from the SMMR and SSM I instruments. The original data were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The data set also contains the source code of the programs that made the calculations. The objective was to derive monthly averages for the whole 13.25-year series (1978-1991) and to derive a composite series of monthly averages representing the variation of an average year. The resulting file set contains monthly images for each of the polar regions for each year, yielding 160 files for each pole, and composite monthly averages in which the years are combined, yielding 12 more files. Averaging the images in this way tends to reduce the number of grid cells that lack valid data; the composite averages are designed to suppress interannual variability. Also included in the data set are programs that can retrieve seasonal ice-concentration profiles at user-specified locations. These nongraphical data retrieval programs are provided in versions for UNIX, extended DOS, and Macintosh computers. Graphical browse utilities are included for the same computing platforms but require more sophisticated display systems. The data contained in this data set are derived from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave  Imager (SSM I) data produced by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado in cooperation with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The basic data come from satellites of the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. NSIDC distributes three collections of sea- ice-concentration grids on CD-ROM: data from the Nimbus-7 SMMR (October 25, 1978 through August 20, 1987) are provided on volume 7 of the SMMR Polar Data series (NASA, 1992); data from the SSM I are provided on two separate volumes, covering the periods from July 9 of 1987 to December 31 of 1989, and from January 1 of 1990 through December 31 of 1991, respectively. The NASATEAM data from revision 2 of the SSM I CD-ROM's were used to create the present data set. SMMR images were collected every 2 to 3 days, whereas SSM I data are provided in daily ice-concentration grids. Apart from a number of small gaps (5 or fewer days) in the record, the only long period for which no data are available is December 3 of 1987 through January 12 of 1988, inclusive. As ancillary data, the ETOPO5 global gridded elevation and bathymetry data (Edwards, 1989) were interpolated to the resolution of the NSIDC data; the interpolated topographic data are included. The images are provided in three formats: Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), a flexible scientific data format developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications; Graphics Interchange Format (GIF); and Macintosh PICT format. The ice- concentration grids are distributed by NSIDC in HDF format..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Weekly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Data Correlating the Shallow GISP2 Dust Profile with the Wolf Sunspot Number Series. ABSTRACT: These data were collected for a research project that utilized the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core. The project sought evidence of an 11-year sunspot cycle and whether the cycle correlated with dust that had been transported by global atmospheric circulation to the summit of Greenland and incorporated into the ice sheet. The dust profile was measured along the top 120 m of the GISP2 B-core using laser-light scattering (LLS) from meltwater. The profile has been dated using the established B-core depth-age scale and ranges from 1597 to 1988 A.D. It contains an average of 13 samples per year. There are significant gaps from 1698 to 1711 and from 1719 to 1727 A.D. where the ice was previously heavily sampled and therefore unavailable for analysis. Based on previous evidence that the GISP2 deep (>1600 m) dust profile contains solar-type variability, investigators correlated the shallow dust profile with the Wolf Sunspot Number (SSN) series. The period under investigation ranges from 1752 to 1988 A.D. This research project was funded by the Arctic System Sciences (ARCSS) Program, grant number OPP-9711609..

TITLE: Radiocarbon Age Data - Eastern, Western and Arctic Canadian Offshore and Selected Lakes. ABSTRACT: Each date is a radiocarbon age determined from Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) sediment samples. Most were analyzed by commercial labs such as Beta and Isotrace although some are from the GSC Radiocarbon Lab in Ottawa. The data set includes all the analytical details and information on the material dated. No assessment of the reliability or significance of the dates is provided.The purpose of this data set of Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) radiocarbon age dates from marine sediment samples is to provide information on carbon age dating and geochronology. The age of seabed material is fundamental to understanding the origin of the sediment and hence to predicting its lateral continuity and behavior.

TITLE: Arctic Oscillation (AO) Index Data. ABSTRACT: The University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) offers an Arctic Oscillation (AO) Index dataset. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is defined as the leading EOF of Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure anomalies poleward of 20N, weighted by area (Thompson and Wallace, 1998). The following indices are generated by projecting various anomaly fields onto the structure of the &AO&, defined here as the leading EOF of SLP poleward of 20N based on all months January 1958 to April 1997. All units are arbitrary. &http:  ao.atmos.colostate.edu  Data AO_TREN_NCEP_Jan1899Current.ascii& AO_TREN_NCEP_Jan1899Current.ascii MONTHLY INDEX January 1899 to present. Found by projecting the AO pattern onto SLP anomalies back to Jan 1899. Index starts Jan 1899, ends June 2002. Index values 1899-December 1957 are based on data described in Trenberth and Paolino (1980). Index values January 1958 to current are from the NCEP NCAR Reanalysis.

TITLE: Heinrich Event Slide Set. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: By understanding past climate variability, scientists hope to understand the course of future changes in the earth's climate system. This slide set outlines past climate variability by reconstructing abrupt climate changes in the Late Pleistocene. The set contains a comprehensive text and accompanying color photos of icebergs, iceberg-rafted debris in marine sediment cores, and laboratory techniques with sediment cores. Detailed graphics and discussion of Heinrich events, their causes, and their climatic significance are also included. This set would be appropriate for a college level audience and could be used as a comprehensive educational tool for studying current issues in oceanography and the implications of natural climate variability from the past to the future. Set also includes a glossary and further reading lists. PURPOSE: Paleoclimatic Education.

TITLE: Level 2.5 daily DMSP SSM I satellite wind speeds with assigned directions (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov products product079.html ). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com  ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao  ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used ( http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata  ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR ( http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets  ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. The Level 2.5 products are derived from the Level 3.0 gridded VAM analyses by assigning directions daily to the wind speed observations for each microwave sensor (DMSP SSM I, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI). Data products are stored in binary "bytemap" files to parallel the original satellite data files from RSS. All observations are mapped to a 25 km grid and packed into 1-byte integers. Data distributed in NetCDF format ( http:  www.unidata.ucar.edu software netcdf  ). All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s. Each data set is archived using the following naming convention: NAME_YYYYMMDD_vVVlLLPPP.TTT.gz where NAME - unique identifier describing the data YYYYMMDD - date time expressed as year, month, day VV - product version number (in tenths) LL - product level designation (in tenths) PPP - product stream (flk or llk) TTT - file type designating the data format For example, "f08_20040101_v10l25flk.nc.gz" designates a level 2.5 (l25) data set containing DMSP SSM I satellite wind speeds with assigned directions for January 1, 2004 from version 1.0 (v10) of the first-look (flk) product stream in NetCDF (.nc) format. The ".gz" node indicates that the file must first be de-compressed using the GNU zip (gzip) compression utility..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Binned 4 KM Seasonal Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Each Aqua MODIS Level-3 binned (4 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a season, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells have a resolution of 4.6x4.6km. Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file.

TITLE: H. Dissemination Area Reference Maps, by non-tracted Census Agglomeration, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The set of Dissemination Area Reference Maps by Non-tracted Census Agglomeration covers the smaller census agglomerations that are not part of the census tract program. Each map in the set covers one census agglomeration (CA) and shows the boundaries and codes of dissemination areas within that CA. The maps also show the boundaries of census subdivisions (municipalities), as well as urban areas, and representative points for designated places. The maps include background information such as rivers, lakes, railroad tracks and provincial boundaries, and other significant features. There are approximately 170 maps in this set?generally two maps per census agglomeration. Some maps include insets to show detail for the congested areas. These insets appear on the main map where possible, but in some cases they appear on a second map sheet. The maps vary in scale and size; the maximum map dimensions are approximately 91 cm by 101 cm (36 inches by 40 inches). A reference guide is available (92F0146GIE). Note: Dissemination area reference maps are also available by census tract for large urban centres?census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations (92F0146XCB, 92F0146XIB, 92F0146XPB) and by census division for areas outside census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations (92F0148XCB, 92F0148XIB, 92F0148XPB). Together, the three sets of dissemination area maps cover all of Canada. Catalogue number for free internet usage is: 92F0147XIB01000 Catalogue number for CD-ROM is: 92F0147XCB01000 Catalogue number for print-on-demand is: 92F0147XPB01000 ...for additional information visit our organization's web site.The maps are designed to enable users to identify the general location and boundaries of the geographic areas for which 2001 Census data are available. The maps should not be used for digitizing purposes nor to determine the precise location of boundaries. They are not intended to serve as a legal or cadastral representation of geographic areas..

TITLE: NRSC Regional Marine Geoid. ABSTRACT: The NRSC's Regional Geoid Product offers the most accurate satellite derived measurement of the marine geoid, providing an inexpensive base dataset for rapid geophysical screening of off-shore sedimentary basins. The product consists of corrected mean sea surface heights referenced to an Earth Ellipsoid. Vertical accuracy's of better than 10cm are achieved through the application of NRSC's waveform-retracking process. Accurate measurement of the marine geoid is important for exploration companies who use the information to derive gravitational fields over offshore basins. These are used to map potential oil-bearing structures beneath the ocean floor. The geoid is generated from Altimeter data acquired by the European Space Agency's ERS-1 satellite, from both the 35-day repeat cycle phase or the 168-day repeat cycle (geodetic phase). The unique retracked dataset produced by the NRSC enables the derivation of precise high frequency geoid information for the first time. Features of the 35-day repeat cycle product include: > Five repeat orbits are used to reduce errors > Vertical accuracy is better than 10cm > Along track resolution is 7km > Across track resolution at 60 degrees latitude is 39km. This is four times more dense than available from previous altimeter-derived datasets such as the Haxby global geoid > Data for the Arctic basin is available for the first time Features of the 168-day repeat cycle product include: > Along track resolution is 2km (resolutions up to 0.5km are available, however the location accuracy of the altimeter sensor is limited to 2km) > Across track resolution at 60 degrees latitude is 4km > Vertical accuracy is around 10cm The Regional Geoid Product consists of geoid undulation heights referenced to a long wavelength geoid model. These are available as a series of points along the original satellite tracks or as a regular gridded dataset. Products are available 'off-the-shelf' for major sedimentary basins including: North East Europe, the Falklands shelf, South East Asia and the Barents and Kara Seas. Products for any other area between 80N and 80S can be generated on demand. The data is supplied in digital form on Exabyte, CD-ROM or CCT. Further details and pricing are available from the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Standard Mapped Product Suite. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color and SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). MODIS Aqua processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html . The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. SST processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit (SST)   8-bit (Ocean Color), two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI ocean color products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: International Ice Patrol Iceberg Drift Tracks. ABSTRACT: The International Ice Patrol (IIP) tracks, plots and predicts iceberg positions in the North Atlantic Ocean. The IIP area of responsibility is 40 to 52 degrees North, 39 to 57 degrees West. During several years (1977, 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1989) individual icebergs were 'tagged' with buoys developed by the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center. The motion of the icebergs bearing the USCG buoys were then tracked via satellite. Observation periods range from one week to two years depending on the buoy. The data are stored in the National Oceanographic Data Center format for drifting buoys (format number 156)..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua and SeaWiFS Level 3 9KM Seasonal Merged Chlorophyll Product. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of merged satellite measurements of global ocean chlorophyll data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform, and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWIFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). MODIS Aqua processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html . SeaWiFS processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html . The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level-3 9 km merged chlorophyll products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods once the refined products for each of the contributing missions are processed. Increased coverage over the single mission product is realized through the merging of the two data sets. There is a substantial improvement (> 50%) in coverage at the daily level, decreasing with the increase in the temporal period binned. The MODIS SeaWiFS merged product is generated in essentially two steps. First, the MODIS Level-3 file is reduced in resolution from 4 to 9 km to match the global resolution of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll product. This involves combining the sum and sum squared field values for the (typically) four 4 km bins into the corresponding single 9 km bin. In the second step, the reduced-resolution MODIS file and the corresponding SeaWiFS Level-3 file are combined. Because both input files are at the same 9 km resolution, the summing is performed bin-by-bin. The Standard Mapped Image file that is generated from the merged Level-3 binned file stores scaled 16 bit integer values rather than the usual 8 bit values, giving the user much greater numerical precision. The actual images displayed on the Ocean Color website in PNG format are provided for visual inspection only.

TITLE: The Atlas of Canada - Glacier Atlas of Canada. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Glacier Inventory Project was initiated in the 1960s as part of Canada's contribution to the International Hydrological Decade (1965-1974) programme for a world inventory of glaciers (Ommanney, 1980), sponsored by Unesco. Basic physical data on Canada's estimated 100,000 glaciers were to be compiled from maps and photographs. This necessitated the adoption of a suitable coding system. In order to establish region and basin identifiers, Canada was subdivided into major basins. In the Arctic, a modification of the coding system developed for polar regions by B.B. Roberts (1963) was used. For mainland Canada, the basin sub-divisions of the Water Survey of Canada were adopted. The Canadian regional identifiers are preceded by * to distinguish the Canadian data set. Subsequent numbers represent the major drainage basins or areas, as follows: *3 - Labrador (Atlantic Ocean), *5 - Nelson River (Hudson Bay), *7 - Slave River (Mackenzie River), *8 - Pacific Ocean, *9 - Yukon River, 11 - Mackenzie District (Arctic Ocean,) 62 - Baffin and Bylot Islands, 64 - High Arctic Islands, 65 - Somerset and Prince of Wales Islands, 67 - Boothia Peninsula, 69 - Victoria and Banks Islands. The original regional numbering system has since been modified by the World Glacier Monitoring Service, in Z?rich, so that Canadian data stored there will not use the same initial alphanumeric codes. Glacier numbers were assigned to individual ice masses by numbering clockwise from the mouth of the basin. Each basin was identified with an alphanumeric code. As this numbering system was the key to all the glacier inventory data, it was decided to publish it in map sheets which could form the basis of a Glacier Atlas of Canada. Separate sheets were printed once the inventory compilation for a particular region had been completed. The maps were prepared initially by photo reduction of a compilation provided by the Glacier Inventory Project. Certain standard procedures were followed to ensure uniformity when seasonal staff were used. All indices were compiled at a scale of 1:250,000 from the 1:50,000 scale inventory work maps. The outline of the final map was drawn on the index using an overlay. The boundary included all glaciers in the basin or basins being shown and as much of the total basin(s) as possible. As all the maps are published in a standard format, the orientation of the map was controlled by the size and shape of the basin(s) and the map frame size. Thus north is not necessarily at the top. The limits were drawn only for those basins for which the glacier numbering was to be shown. Solid lines were used to divide major regions and dashed lines the individual basins. Only the outline of the glaciers is shown, the margin of the ice and the major nunataks. Divides between individual glaciers were omitted. Sufficient hydrography was marked to indicate the direction of flow of most of the glacier melt water. A scribe coat was produced directly from this compilation and all further work was carried out by the Drafting Unit of the Inland Waters Directorate. The Atlas plates were numbered using a decimal system with the first two digits corresponding to the major region and basin. The final digit was a sequential number covering individual maps. Four maps per plate were printed for economy of production. A full list of the maps published and contained in this Atlas is given. The work was begun in the Inland Waters Branch (IWB) which later became a Directorate (IWD) and moved from the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR) to the Department of the Environment (DOE). In the mid-1970s, publication of this series was suspended. As it is now extremely unlikely that the series can be continued in its present form, a decision was made in 1989 to distribute a few limited-edition bound volumes of those maps already published to selected reference libraries. Sincere thanks are extended to John W. Clarkson and Mary M. Strome who were instrumental in the compilation of most of these maps. The glacier inventory data associated with these glacier numbers and extensive records on many of Canada's other glaciers are kept by the Scientific Information Division, National Hydrology Research Institute, Environment Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 3H5.

TITLE: Global Archive of Ortho-rectified Landsat Data. ABSTRACT: Recognizing the need to provide high-resolution satellite data to the scientific community, NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing Program Office, has been working to assemble the first wall-to-wall global coverage of ortho-rectified Landsat Thematic Mapper and Multi Spectral Scanner data to support scientific studies. In August of 1998, NASA contracted with MDA (then EarthSat) to produce positionally accurate orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper and Multispectral Scanner imagery covering the majority of the Earth's land mass. Scene selection, acquisition, and processing of Landsat data is done by MDA Federal Inc. (http:  www.mdafederal.com). There are two separate product lines developed from the GeoCover Project: 1. EarthSat GeoCover-Ortho (Orthorectified) products are the actual satellite images derived from Landsat TM scenes and are the most accurate, commercially available base maps of the world. 2. EarthSat GeoCover-LC (Land Cover) products consist of a medium resolution land cover database, prepared from consistently orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The Landsat imagery used to create the GeoCover-Ortho products have been hand selected to provide the lowest cloud cover and highest quality data possible. The Landsat TM imagery are all circa 1990 and have been selected as close to the local peak growing season as possible. The imagery have been collected from the majority of the Landsat foreign ground stations, as well as from the US Government's EROS Data Center. Never before has such a complete collection of high quality Landsat imagery been assembled for processing and analysis. The GeoCover-Ortho image map data sets represents a milestone in the use of Landsat digital imagery to map and study the Earth's surface.

TITLE: Federal 2-D Densification Network, North of Canada, Level 1. ABSTRACT: Geodetic Survey Division (GSD) provides a horizontal 2-D (NAD83) network of interconnected control surveys with (approximately 13000) monuments spaced 20 to a maximum of 100 km apart for the Yukon Territory, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. These networks are comprised of physically marked survey stations across Canada for which horizontal coordinates are determined. These networks have been established over the past 90 years to provide consistent and accurate basic frameworks within which project-specific surveys may be carried out. The data format of the FED2DNC1 information could be GML (ASCII) or SHAPE. FED2DNC1 information would include geographic and UTM coordinates, orthometric elevation, marker information description, and inspection data.The Horizontal 2-D Network (NAD83) is designed to serve as a 2-D framework of reference for positioning in the North (the geodetic Canadian Spatial Reference System - CSRS).

TITLE: AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 5 km EASE-Grid Composites. ABSTRACT: The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 5 km EASE-Grid Composites are a collection of products for both poles, consisting of twice-daily calibrated and gridded satellite channel data and derived parameters. Data include five AVHRR channels, clear sky surface broadband albedo and skin temperature, solar zenith angle, satellite elevation angle, sun-satellite relative azimuth angle, surface type mask, cloud mask, and Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) of acquisition. AVHRR Polar Pathfinder data extend pole ward from 48.4 degrees north and 53.2 degrees south latitudes, from 24 July 1981 through 30 June 2005. Data are in 1-byte and 2-byte integer grid format and are available by FTP. Note: Due to a problem with the NOAA-16 scan motor, all the channel data is shifted sporadically between 2001 and 2005, causing the channels to contain data from another channel; thus, the derived parameters also contain errors during this time-period. See Table 12 in the Error sources section of the guide document for specific dates..

TITLE: DMSP SSM I Daily Polar Gridded Brightness Temperatures. ABSTRACT: NSIDC produces daily gridded brightness temperature (Tb) data from orbital (swath) data generated by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) mounted on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F8, F11, and F13 platforms. The gridded brightness temperatures are distributed in polar stereographic projection. SSM I is a seven-channel, four-frequency, orthogonally polarized passive microwave radiometric system. The channels are 19.3 GHz vertical and horizontal, 22.2 GHz vertical only, 37.0 GHz vertical and horizontal, and 85.5 GHz vertical and horizontal. Orbital data for each 24-hour period are mapped to respective grid cells using a simple 'drop in the bucket' sum and average method. 85.5 GHz data are gridded at a resolution of 12.5 km, with all other frequencies at a resolution of 25 km. All SSM I Tb gridded data are stored as scaled 2-byte integers in flat binary arrays and are available via FTP..

TITLE: Predictive Model of Golden Eagle Distribution in Idaho and Montana. ABSTRACT: Because of growing concern in recent years about the status of golden eagle populations in western North America and the need for a more complete understanding of the preferences of this species, we developed a Predictive Model of Golden Eagle Distribution in Idaho and Montana. This preliminary model follows a Resource Selection Functions (RSF) approach for golden eagles and is based on data collected via satellite telemetry from 6 golden eagles tracked in the western U.S from 1996-1998. The initial golden eagle predictive model is done at a relatively low resolution; the dataset includes the predictive layer and was created from 5 different environmental data layers that were originally compiled and published elsewhere. GIS overlays were reformatted and merged from diverse sources (including state GAP programs, USGS, Snake River Field Station, ESRI and other sources). Aspect, slope, river and road distance were derived from the original data layers. All work was completed in ArcView 3.3. For model building we used MARS and CART from Salford Systems..

TITLE: NIC Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice Data. ABSTRACT: Note: This product has been replaced by the more comprehensive environmental working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea ice Atlas. ("http:  nsidc.org data G01962.html") Data are digitized weekly sea ice concentration and extent grids for the Arctic (extending to 45 degrees north, 1972 - 1994) and the Antarctic (extending to 50 degrees south, 1973 - 1994). The Arctic data are divided into two sections: Arctic East (90 W - 90 E, centered on the Greenwich meridian) and Arctic West (90 E - 90 W, centered on the International Date Line.) The grids are digitized at the National Climatic Data Center from weekly charts prepared by the Navy NOAA National Ice Center, Suitland. Charts are 1:11.6 million for the Northern Hemisphere, and 1:16 million for the Southern Hemisphere, azimuthal equidistant projection, point of tangency at the pole. The ice edge is accurate to within 5 to 10 km in clear conditions; with extreme cloudiness accuracy may deteriorate to 100 km. Data sources include AVHRR LAC, GAC and HRPT, DMSP OLS (visible and infrared) and SSM I (passive microwave), and aerial reconnaissance from U.S. Navy, Canadian and Danish sources. Weekly gridded data are stored in a WMO standard format called SIGRID..

TITLE: Greenland Airborne Precision Elevation Survey (GRAPES) Data Collected by NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). ABSTRACT: Ice sheet elevation data are collected over Greenland with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). The data are known as the Greenland Airborne Precision Elevation Survey (GRAPES). The ATM is a laser altimeter flown on NASA aircraft. The Global Positioning System (GPS) of orbiting satellites is used to navigate the aircraft's autopilot in order to provide precise location information for repeat coverage. The data are collected yearly starting in 1991. The GRAPES data currently available include results from the 1993 mission, with other data to be included soon. Flight trajectory data are available for all years beginning with 1993. The data collected by ATM form baseline measurements of ice elevation of Greenland. The data will be used in conjunction with the future elevation measurements of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument onboard the ICESat satellite (to be launched in 2001). Changes in ice sheet elevation measurements provide a better understanding of glacial changes that may be due to global climate change.

TITLE: Arctic Environmental Change of the Last Four Centuries. ABSTRACT: Abstract (from the online documentation): A compilation of paleoclimate records from lake sediments, trees, glaciers, and marine sediments provides a view of circum-Arctic environmental variability over the last 400 years. From 1840 to the mid-20th century, the Arctic warmed to the highest levels in four centuries. This warming ended the Little Ice Age in the Arctic and has caused dramatic retreats of glaciers, melting of permafrost and sea-ice, and alteration of terrestrial and lake ecosystems. Although significant warming, particularly after 1920, was likely due to increases in atmospheric trace-gases, the initiation of the warming in the mid-19th century suggests that increased solar irradiance, decreased volcanic activity, and feedbacks internal to the climate system played roles.

TITLE: Global Ocean Analysis Assimilation. ABSTRACT: This data set is a global assimilation analysis of the ocean using a General Circulation Model of the oceans based on the GFDL MOM2 code to study the ocean's role in climate variability. The assimilation algorithm is an extension of Optimum Interpolation. Winds are provided by a monthly COADS analysis. Surface and subsurface temperature updating is carried out using most historical shipboard and satellite temperature information. The analyses are constructed using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) analysis package. SODA is an application of data assimilation using a forecast model based on GFDL ocean physics driven by observed historical meteorology (winds, heating, and rainfall-evaporation), assimilating historical observations of temperature, salinity, sea level, SST, and surface current.

TITLE: Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Database and Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Database (Janus) at Texas AM University. ABSTRACT: These databases contain geological and geophysical investigations of the cores recovered from almost every ocean of the world. The data were collected on oceanographic cruises of the Deep Sea Drilling Program and the Ocean Drilling Program. Janus Web provides access to ODP's Oracle relational database Janus. The database contains 450 tables of ODP's marine geoscience data that are collected onboard the drillship JOIDES Resolution. The database includes paleontological, lithostratigraphic, chemical, physical, sedimentological, and geophysical data for ocean sediments and hard rocks. Janus has been used to collect data since Leg 171A (January 1997). During the first postcruise (moratorium) year, access to proprietary ODP data is only given to scientists who participated on the cruise. Proprietary data are released to the public one year after the end of each cruise. Non-proprietary data such as ODP & DSDP site information are available to everyone. Data collected prior to Leg 171A are being added to Janus as time permits. Some of the Janus data is available in the CHRONOS system (http:  www.chronos.org ).

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Data from the Scientific Ice Expeditions (SCICEX), Available from Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. ABSTRACT: The Scientific Ice Expeditions (SCICEX) are a joint collaboration between the U.S. Navy and university scientists. The Navy made available a nuclear-powered submarine for unclassified scientific research cruises in the Arctic Ocean. The advantage of the submarine is it's high maneuverability compared to an ice-breaker, and that oceanographic measurements can be made under the Arctic's ice sheet. Data have been collected from over 100,000 miles of ship track, begining in 1993 with the test cruise and continuing during the five years of the project from 1995 through 1999. Data include, but are not limited to, physical and chemical measurments of water using CTDs and bottle measurements, bottom topography using side-scan sonar, and biological samplings of bacteria and amphipods.

TITLE: MMS Aerial Surveys for Seabirds and Mammals, Oregon and Washington. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Oregon and Washington Marine Mammal And Seabird Surveys Sstudies: -- Oregon Washington Aerial [Birds and Mammals] Study Code: OP Contract Number: 14-12-0001-30426 Principal Investigator(s) Affiliation: G. A. Green, Ebasco Environmental, Bellevue, Washington, M. L. Bonnell and K. T. Briggs, Ecological Consulting, Inc., Portland, Oregon PURPOSE: OBJECTIVES: Objectives of the study were to review and analyze all available literature and databases concerning marine mammal and seabird diversity, distribution, and abundance in the Oregon-Washington coastal and offshore areas; to conduct field surveys over a 18-month period and to prepare reports summarizing the findings. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: April 1989 through October 1990 STUDY AREA: Pacific Ocean waters of Oregon and Washington from the coast to approximately 60 nautical miles offshore. METHODOLGY: Aerial surveys were conducted along 32 pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Coastal surveys and one shelf break survey were also conducted. Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and turtles were recorded. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega. One ship survey was also conducted from aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman during August 1989. DATABASES PRODUCED: Databases produced include 1) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 12 aerial surveys and one ship cruise, and 2) sightings of cetaceans on 12 aerial surveys and one ship cruise.

TITLE: Polar Pathfinder Sampler: AVHRR, SMMR-SSM I, and TOVS Samples and Combined Time Series. ABSTRACT: Notice to Users: Distribution of this data set will be discontinued by 31 December 2009, or earlier, should user requests for the Polar Pathfinder Sampler CD-ROM exceed our supply before that date. The AVHRR, SMMR-SSM I and TOVS Polar Pathfinder research teams collaborated to make it as easy as possible to use Polar Pathfinder data sets together by employing a common projection, namely the NSIDC Equal-Area Scalable Earth-Grid (EASE-Grid), and validation methods to develop consistently processed data sets that are easy to combine, compare and contrast. This CD-ROM includes sample data, time-series visualizations, and browse products, for temporal and spatial subsets of the AVHRR, SMMR-SSM I and TOVS data sets, to illustrate the types of products available for the various data sets. AVHRR products for both hemispheres, at 1.25 and 5 km resolutions, include calibrated channel data, surface broadband albedo, surface temperature, and ancillary data so that users can apply algorithms of their choice to calculate albedo and surface temperature. To conserve space, the CD-ROM includes 1.25 km AVHRR time-series visualizations, rather than raw data; and 5 km AVHRR sample data (for 8 September 1997), movies and browse images. SMMR-SSM I parameters, that can be derived from global brightness temperatures, include snow water equivalent, snow extent, seasonal sea ice concentrations, location of multiyear ice, ocean wind speed, cloud liquid water over oceans and water vapor over oceans. The CD-ROM contains a sample data set comprising selected SSM I brightness temperature data and time files for 8 September 1997 (the same day as in the 5 km AVHRR data, to facilitate comparisons) in each of three projections: Northern and Southern Hemispheres and a global projection. TOVS parameters derived from arctic radiances include atmospheric temperature profiles, water vapor, surface temperature, total effective cloud fraction, cloud top pressure and temperature, turning angle between geostrophic wind and surface stress over ice, emissivity, boundary layer stratification and geostrophic drag coefficient. The CD-ROM includes sample TOVS products for four selected dates in 1988. The P-Cube is a multidimensional structure combining arctic SSM I, AVHRR and TOVS data, all mapped to a 100 km resolution EASE-Grid, thereby facilitating study of polar processes and interactions among them using data from multiple sensors. The current prototype version of the P-Cube includes the most important parameters from the three Polar Pathfinders noted above. The Polar Pathfinder Sampler CD-ROM is currently the only source of the P-Cube data; temporal coverage extends from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1989. All data at the original resolution are now available. See NOAA NASA Polar Pathfinder Data or contact User Services for more information..

TITLE: Arctic Climatology Project - EWG Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas. ABSTRACT: The Environmental Working Group (EWG) was established in June 1995 under the framework of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. In January 1996, the EWG Arctic Climatology Group took on the task of compiling digital data on arctic regions to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic. This work resulted in a set of three atlases on CD-ROM for arctic oceanography, sea ice, and meteorology. The Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas was developed by specialists from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia, the University of Washington, Seattle, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado, Boulder. The Atlas contains three main sections: a history section, a 'Primer,' and a data section. The history section and Primer provide background and introductory information for newcomers to arctic meteorology, while the data section contains gridded fields of meteorological parameters, and newly released meteorological station data from Russian and other sources. In addition, the Atlas includes several English translations of Russian technical documents, and a glossary of meteorological terms in English and Russian. Users can order the CD-ROM free of charge from NSIDC User Services Office. NSIDC also distributes the EWG Joint U.S.-Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean (Winter and Summer periods on two CD-ROMs), and the EWG Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas free of charge.

TITLE: Greenland 5 km DEM, Ice Thickness, and Bedrock Elevation Grids. ABSTRACT: A Digital Elevation Model (DEM), ice thickness grid, and bedrock elevation grid of Greenland acquired as part of the PARCA program are available in ASCII text format at a 5 km grid spacing in a polar stereographic projection. DEM data are a combination of ERS-1 and Geosat satellite radar altimetry data, Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) data, and photogrammetric digital height data. Ice thickness data are based on approximately 700,000 data points collected in the 1990s from a University of Kansas airborne ice penetrating radar (IPR). Nearly 30,000 data points were collected in the 1970s from a Technical University of Denmark (TUD) airborne echo sounder. Bamber subtracted the ice thickness grid from the DEM to produce a grid of bedrock elevation values. Applications include studies of gravitational driving stress and ice volume (mass balance) of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Each of the three grids is approximately 1.5 MB. Data are available via FTP. Data access is unrestricted, but we recommend that users register with us. Registered users automatically receive e-mail notification of product updates and changes to processing..

TITLE: Historical Sea Ice Time Series from the Atlantic Arctic. ABSTRACT: The ‘Historical Sea Ice Time Series from the Atlantic Arctic’ data are a compilation of existing century-scale time series derived from historical observations and sea ice charts from a range of sources. The purpose of the dataset is to provide a convenient compilation and consistent description of these published though scattered data. Provided here are various indices of sea-ice conditions, ranging from estimated sea-ice extent, sea-ice edge, sea-ice export and sea-ice incidence (duration). The original time series were constructed by individual researchers using various sources ranging from historical ice charts to annals and other descriptive information. Spatial and temporal coverage varies. Spatially, the data span the Atlantic Arctic from Newfoundland to the Barents and Baltic Seas. The representativeness of each series is typically sub-regional (10s of km) to regional (100s of km). Temporally, the time series are range from approximately one to three centuries. There a very few years with missing values, usually in the early part of the series. There is generally one value per year; however, the effective temporal resolution is sub-annual, typically representing a seasonal indicator..

The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Landsat TM and MSS data from Eurimage. ABSTRACT: Eurimage distributes, in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, Landsat data received at the following European Space Agency (ESA) ground receiving stations: Fucino (Italy) Kiruna (Sweden) Maspalomas (Canary Islands, Spain) Fucino has been acquiring MSS and TM data since 1975 and 1984, respectively. Kiruna started in 1978 and 1984, respectively, but stopped acquiring in December 1993. Maspalomas commenced acquiring MSS data in 1984 and TM data in 1987, but acquisition stopped at the end of 1990. Maspalomas acquisition restarted at the end of March 1994, and since then has established a pattern of about 4 months acquisition during the late spring and summer each year. Production of Maspalomas data is currently carried out at Fucino. These stations provide coverage of Western and Eastern Europe, North and West Africa and northern parts of the Middle East. Eurimage also supplies Landsat data coverage of other parts of the world, through its access to the EOSAT archive, which has coverage of large areas of the world dating back to 1972; or by supplying data through EOSAT from international ground stations. Eurimage provides on-line access to data from Landsat through EiNet on the WWW. EiNet is a subscription service which allows users to browse quick look images and meta data from serveral Earth Observation satellites. Einet is accessed via the WWW at: http:  www.eurimage.com products landsat.html.

TITLE: Arctic Radiation Measurement in Column: Atmosphere-Surface (ARMCAS) MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) Level-1B Data Products. ABSTRACT: The objective of the Arctic Radiation Measurement in Column: Atmosphere-Surface (ARMCAS) experiment was to detect and differentiate between clouds, ice, and snow over Northern Alaska. This experiment will also help determine the scattering albedo of clouds at selected wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared bands. The data was collected for the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) project. This data will help define, develope, and test algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor which is a key sensor of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). The ARMCAS data are available from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center L1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS). The data cover the Brooks Range, North Slope, and Bering Sea in Alaska.

TITLE: Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 1002 Area, Petroleum Assessment, 1998 CD-ROM. ABSTRACT: The following was abstracted from the USGS home page at "http:  pubs.usgs.gov fs fs-0028-01 " The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (1980) established the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) (fig. 1) as a wildlife refuge. In section 1002 of that act, Congress deferred a decision regarding future management of the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain ("1002 area") in recognition of the area's potentially enormous oil and gas resources and its importance as wildlife habitat. A report on the resources (including petroleum) of the 1002 area was submitted in 1987 to Congress by the Department of the Interior (DOI). Since completion of that report, numerous wells have been drilled and oil fields discovered near ANWR (fig. 2), new geologic and geophysical data have become available, seismic processing and interpretation capabilities have improved, and the economics of North Slope oil development have changed significantly. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) commonly is asked to provide the Federal Government with timely scientific information in support of decisions regarding land management, environmental quality, and economic and strategic policy. To do so, the USGS must anticipate issues most likely to be the focus of policymakers in the future. Anticipating the need for scientific information and considering the decade-old perspective of the petroleum resource estimates included in the 1987 Report to Congress, the USGS has reexamined the geology of the ANWR 1002 area and prepared a new petroleum resource assessment..

TITLE: Kittlitz's Murrelet. Birds of North America. ABSTRACT: The Kittlitz's Murrelet Brachyramphus brevirostris is bird is a species of environmental concern, and only 21 confirmed nest locations are published for North America. A wider analysis of these nest sites is coming forward, and it appears that these nests are associated with glaciers and vulcanoe slopes. However, this is only an impression based on the small sample of nests. This species also occurs in Russia, but only few details are known. The species is reported to underlie drastic declines during the last 20 years, likely due to global change, e.g. glacier retreat. The data presented here are derived from a species account (Day et al. 1999) and geo-referenced in Arc View GIS. They can be used for further analyzing and modeling in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Caution is to be taken when interpreting these nest locations because the sample size is extremely low, and nests were found in a somewhat opportunistic fashion. For use and interpretation of this data set, please contact experts..

TITLE: Global 30-Arc-Second Elevation Data Set. ABSTRACT: Digital elevation model (DEM) data are sampled arrays of surface elevations in raster form. A DEM provides elevation values in rows and columns, corresponding to a regular grid of points on the Earth's surface. The Global 30-Arc-Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30) is so named, because the spacing between adjacent elevation points is 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 kilometer) of latitude and longitude. Completed in 1997, the GTOPO30 data set was developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center over a 3-year period with support from several national and international cooperators. Using eight data sources, a global 30-arc-second DEM resulted from this cooperative effort. The GTOPO30 data are suitable for many regional and continental applications, including climate modeling; continental-scale land cover mapping; extraction of drainage features for hydrologic modeling; and geometric and atmospheric correction of medium- and coarse-resolution satellite image data..

TITLE: Landsat 7 Orthorectified Imagery over Canada. ABSTRACT: The orthoimage data set is a complete set of cloud-free (less than 10%) orthoimages covering the Canadian landmass and created with the most accurate control data available at the time of creation. The imagery has been corrected with either provincial and aerial triangulation data or, if not available, the most accurate NTDB data. The objective is to obtain accuracy of 30 metres or better in the South and 50 metres or better in the North for a 90% level of confidence. The accuracy is evaluated for each orthoimage data set. The control data, which has been extracted from sources as mentioned above, can consist of road intersection vector data or lake island centroids. In some cases the intersection of the centre line of surficial river may have been used. The control points are distributed homogeneously within the image in specific sectors. Sectors are located in the surround of the image, in the lowest and highest elevation area of the image, and in all other areas in which overlapping image base sectors are located.The purpose is to promote the use of geomatics and educate by providing a Web and file transfer protocol (ftp) site that distributes Canada's geospatial data. The objective of the national orthoimage project is to produce a complete set of cloud-free (less than 10%) orthoimages covering the Canadian landmass using Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data from the Landsat-7 satellite. Production, which began in fall 2000, will span a period of three to five years.

TITLE: Vector Map Level 0 (VMap0) and Vector Map Level 1 (VMap1). ABSTRACT: The Vector Map Level 0 (VMap0) and Vector Map Level 1 (VMap1) databases are designed to provide vector-based geospatial data at low (VMap0) and medium (VMap1) resolutions. The content of VMap0 database is similar to the previously published Digital Chart of the World (DCW), enhanced with low-resolution bathymetry for global coverage. A reference library with general information is included to orient the user, while the index of geographic names helps in locating areas of interest. The content of VMap1 database corresponds to the topographic maps at the 1:250 000 scale. The VMap1 data originate from the National Topographic Data Base (NTDB) at the 1:250 000 scale. Different map sections and recoded entities in FACC (Feature Attribute Coding Catalog) codes according to VMap1 data specifications were added to the NTDB's data. The VMap0 data are organized in topologically layered data, representing six continental regions of the world. They are contained on four CD-ROM for nearly two gigabytes of data: Disk 1 - North America (NOAMER) Disk 2 - Europe and North Asia (EURNASIA) Disk 3 - South America, Africa, and Antarctic (SOAMAFR) Disk 4 - South Asia and Australia (SASAUS) The VMap1 data are organized in topologically layered data and sectioned in libraries. The Canadian territory is covered by 24 librairies of different sizes and map sections. Finally, the VMap0 and VMap1 databases consist in twelve thematic layers: boundaries, industry, tile reference, data quality, library reference, transportation, elevation, physiography, utilities, hydrography, population, vegetation. The primary source for the database is the 1:1 000 000 scale Operation Navigation Chart (ONC) series, coproduced by the military mapping authorities of Canada and many other countries. Data gaps may exist where source information is not available.VMap0 and VMap1 are an excellent source of base information for all aspects of global (VMap0), national and regional (VMap1) monitoring as well as for studying and developing research methodologies in geography, spatial analysis, earth sciences, social sciences, resource management, and communications. It provides a base for an unlimited number of value-added spatial overlays.

TITLE: Geomatics for High School Curriculum, Ontario, Canada. ABSTRACT: The Geomatics for High School Curriculum consists of Internet distributed geography lessons available in French and English for grades 9 to 12 that meet Ontario High School curriculum standards. The series of lessons can be conveniently adapted for other provinces. This Web Site was developed as a cooperative project with support and input from the federal government, private industry and high school teachers and presents two components: "Geography of Canada mapped by Ecozones, Grade 9 Academic & Applied courses" and 'Thinking Globally in the Local Classroom, Canada and World Issues: A geographic Analysis, Grade 12, University Preparation". "Geography of Canada mapped by Ecozones" makes use of diverse ecological data from EcoMap and the ecozone framework and utilizes GIS techniques for visualization, analysis and problem solving. The lessons are designed to provide the resources and data necessary to explore ten grade 9 geography topics using Canada's ecozones as a common base. As well as resource and background information, each lesson details a GIS exercise and provides the data required to run it. These lessons are designed to be a dynamic resource for teaching and learning Canadian geography, and expose students to leading-edge technology that will introduce them to GIS and geomatics on the Internet. The lessons also provide the users with links to other data and information sites that can be accessed through the Internet. Each lesson has been set-up with a common structure that presents: * General expectations * Lesson objectives * Background information * Student activities * Teacher support * Data download On the other hand, "Thinking Globally in the Local Classroom" is a Web site developed with the support and input from the "GLOBAL CLASSROOM INITIATIVE", a new CIDA (Canadian International Development Agencies) resource for educators wishing to encourage Canadian youth to actively explore international-cooperation issues. Development of the site has been a cooperative project between NGO's, private industry and high school teachers. The goal of the project "Thinking Globally in the Local Classroom" is to help students develop the skills knowledge, and values they need to become responsible citizens and informed participants of an increasingly interdependent world. This is achieved through activity modules that include background information, fact sheets, resources and Geographic Information System (GIS) lessons on four global themes: Sustainable Development, The Global Economy, Basic Education for All and Promote and Protect Human Rights. These modules are designed to be a dynamic resource that Ontario teachers can use in the "Canadian and World Studies" curriculum in particular for the Grade 12 course "Canada and World Issues : A geographic Analysis". The modules are also relevant to other Social Studies and Humanities courses in Ontario and in other Canadian provinces.The objective of the project was to develop a series of lessons suited for Ontario's curriculum that could be distributed over the Internet. These lessons could become an important tool for high school teachers and students and have several distinct goals: * To teach Canadian geography in a new and exciting format that emphasizes the development of knowledge, applications and current environmental geospatial information; * To provide a resource of lesson plans and guidance for teachers; * To use geomatics information to explore the diverse nature of the Canadian Ecozones, Canadian Studies and World Issues; * To teach GIS and web-search techniques in geomatics applications; and, * To provide Internet access to lessons and resource material.

TITLE: Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment (CEAREX) Data. ABSTRACT: CEAREX was a multi-platform field program conducted in the Norwegian Seas and Greenland north to Svalbard from September 1988 through May 1989. Canada, Denmark, France, Norway and the United States participated in the experiment. Primary data from CEAREX are available on CD-ROM in ASCII format along with some data from the Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX) and the Eurasian Basin Experiment (EUBEX). CD-ROM production was supported by the Arctic Program of the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Meteorology data from CEAREX and the MIZEX (1983, 1984, 1987) include near-surface time series and rawinsonde (upper-air sounding) profiles of wind, pressure, temperature, and humidity collected on ship platforms and ice floe stations. A collection of hydrography data include CTD, STD, and bottle data from a ship and two operations camps. Hydrography data also include data from the MIZEX, the EUBEX, NODC archives, and a merged set of data from five other cruises. Sea ice data consist of compressive stress measurements made in a multi-year floe, stress sensor data for time series of stress invariants, and ice accelerometer data for movements associated with the deformation of multi-year ice floes. Noise data consist of acoustic measurements from a variety of hydrophone and geophone arrays, and ambient noise observations from a ship using omni-directional hydrophones tethered beneath the ice cover. Biophysical data on the CD-ROM include bottle sample, zooplankton sampling, and bioluminescence data. Bathymetry data consist of gridded trackline data collected from the two operations camps, and digital bottom bathymetry and continental topography data for the Fram Strait region and a portion of the Arctic Ocean. Sample position data consist of hourly listings of position and velocity for both manned stations and unmanned drifting buoys. Data are available on one CD-ROM..

TITLE: ASTER On-Demand L2 Brightness Temperature at the Sensor. ABSTRACT: The ASTER On-Demand L2 Brightness Temperature at the Sensor product is generated using the 5 thermal infrared bands within the 8 to 12 micrometer range. Brightness temperature results from the apparent temperature of the imaged surface based on a surface emissivity of 1.0 (the equivalent of a blackbody object). The Brightness Temperature at Sensor product ignores atmospheric effects. The radiance at the sensor is the integral over the instrument response function of the emissivity times the blackbody radiance. Spectral emissivity and temperature function as unknown values in this equation. The Brightness Temperature algorithm converts the radiance values from source L1B data into corresponding brightness temperature values by setting the emissivity equal to one, which is based on the assumption that the target is a blackbody. Brightness temperature is defined as the temperature that a blackbody assumes to produce the radiance perceived by the sensor. The output product is a five-band data set in units of degrees centigrade, scaled by a factor of 100. Brightness temperature products have been used to observe vastly different events--from detection of volcanic ash clouds to the ice leads in the Arctic.

TITLE: Mount Logan Ice Core Isotope and Accumulation Data, NOAA NCDC WDC Paleoclimatology. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of a 301-year snow accumulation record from from Mount Logan, Yukon Territory, Canada. Snow accumulation is in meters, water equivalent, Estimated error + - 0.05 m (max). The data have been updated from original 1980 core, in 1981, 1986, 1988 and 2000. [Abstract] The relatively short length of most instrumental climate records restricts the study of climate variability, and it is therefore essential to extend the record into the past with the help of proxy data. Only since the late 1940s have atmospheric data been available that are sufficient in quality and spatial resolution to identify the dominant patterns of climate variability, such as the Pacific North America pattern and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Here we present a 301-year snow accumulation record from an ice core at a height of 5,340 m above sea level - from Mount Logan, in northwestern North America. This record shows features that are closely linked with the Pacific North America pattern for the period of instrumental data availability. Our record extends back in time to cover the period from the closing stages of the Little Ice Age to the warmest decade in the past millennium. We find a positive, accelerating trend in snow accumulation after the middle of the nineteenth century. This trend is paralleled by a warming over northwestern North America which has been associated with secular changes in both the Pacific North America pattern and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation..

TITLE: Near Global Ocean Currents Climatology by Meehl from NCAR. ABSTRACT: These monthly climatologies were prepared by G. Meehl and are archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). G. Meehl prepared a 5 X 5 degree latitude longitude dataset of long-period ocean currents speed and direction based on pilot charts covering the world ocean southward to about 50 S. The pilot charts are based on summaries of ship drift data. One of the charts was updated about 1984, after the tape data was prepared. The digital data is available for January, April, July, and October representing the four seasons. Meehl (1982) decided to use pilot charts in constructing an observed seasonal source of global ocean surface currents. These charts are prepared by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), and among numerous other quantities, arrows on these charts show surface current directions labeled with current speeds in either knots or nautical miles per hour. Data for the pilot charts are based on long-term mean current speeds and directions already derived from the NAVOCEANO shipdrift file. A ship drift is the difference between its true position and its predicted position calculated 24 hours earlier by dead reckoning; this difference can be attributed to wind and ocean currents. This data set provides the flexibility needed to produce a source of observed surface currents in a suitable format for use in ocean model and diagnostic studies..

TITLE: Aerial Survey Database for Canada (ASDB). ABSTRACT: The Aerial Survey Database (ASDB) is a data bank of photogrammetric control points that have been established through the process of aerotriangulation. The primary purpose of this database is to provide a minimum of four points for the compilation of each photogrammetric model contained in a 1:50,000 National Topographic Series (NTS) map sheet. The photogrammetric points can also be transferred to newly acquired aerial photography or satellite imagery and used as control for different derived products such as Digital Elevation Models, Digital Orthophotos, and Digital Perspective Scenes. The ASDB is divided into blocks; each block consists of several aerial photographs and diapostives covering one or several 1:50,000 NTS map sheets. The blocks are always identified by an alphanumeric code such as "H013" the letters in the code are used to identify the province or region (H=British Columbia), while the numbers indicate the order in which the particular block was completed within the designated area. The database consists of paper prints of the aerial photographs, along with the corresponding diapositives and the results of the photogrammetric adjustment. The adjustment contains (X,Y,Z) co-ordinates of all photogrammetric points. There are approximately two million points and 175,000 aerial photographs and diapositives in the Aerial Survey Database covering roughly 60 percent of the Canadian landmass.To provide a minimum of four points for the compilation of each photogrammetric model contained in a 1:50,000 National Topographic Series map sheet.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Daily Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Arctic & Antarctic Research Center (AARC) AVHRR and HRPT Direct Readout Radiance Data from McMurdo and Palmer Stations, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: AVHRR HRPT level 0 raw telemetry data are acquired at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Center (AARC) on selective passes by satellite receivers located at McMurdo Station, Antarctica (77 degrees, 51 minutes S, 166 degrees, 40 minutes E.) and Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula (64 degrees, 46 minutes S, 64 degrees, 4 minutes W.) Generally, most of the Antarctic continent and its coastline are covered daily. Swaths are 2250 kilometers long and generally start or end over the extreme South Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Ross Sea. Data collection from Palmer Station covers the land areas of West Antarctica, Southern South America, the South Atlantic including the Falkland Islands and the South Orkney Islands, and the Drake Passage and portions of the South Pacific Ocean. Continuous data collection at the McMurdo Station began on 26 October 1987. Data are also archived for 30 October 1985 - 2 December 1985 and for 30 October 1986 - 30 January 1987. Continuous data collection began at the Palmer Station 3 August 1989. The data resolution is 1100 meters at subtrack, 4000 - 6000 meters at limb; 360 scans per minute. Satellite revisit time is twice daily, however, due to the proximity to the South Pole, 14 passes a day are received at McMurdo and 10 passes a day are received at Palmer from each spacecraft. Data are acquired, archived, processed for requesters, and distributed by the Arctic & Antarctic Research Center (AARC). Processing of the raw data will depend on the requirements of the requester, but a typical sequence might be as follows: + Reformat raw data for extraction; up to 10 missing scan lines can be interpolated by the software. + Calibrate the reformatted data to convert from brightness values to temperature values. + Apply the moisture atmospheric correction. + Register selected data to the user-specified grid. + Transfer to user-specified medium. Some examples are tape, diskette, photographic product, or file format for electronic transfer. About 95 percent of the presently archived data have been cataloged on our online directory. Data dropouts, caused by transmission interference due to solar flare activity, occur in some images; the processing software can smooth the data if fewer than 10 scan lines are missing. All archived images contain usable data. Processed data are binary byte arrays of user-defined size. Full spacecraft attitude correction and earth correction routines are applied to the raw data to create the products. Orbital elements, equator crossings, altitude and period of the spacecraft are generated for the raw data using the AARC scientific workstation. Data products can be gridded to a user-specified grid. Data are also available in raw form (10 bits of information stored in a 16 bit word) on 4mm DDS2 or DDS3 DAT cassettes or DLT7000 tapes. Users would need access to an 4mm DAT or DLT7000 reader. An alternative method to access the digital archive is to use the Sun Workstations located at the AARC, Scripps Institution of Oceanography. AARC personnel can be contacted for access information..

TITLE: Paleoenvironment, Geomorphic Processes, and Carbon Stocks of Drained Thaw-lake Basins in the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska, USA, 2002-2005. ABSTRACT: These data are from a study of the origin and associated geomorphological, ecological, and pedological processes of thaw-lake basins of the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. The research utilized high-resolution multispectral satellite data, ground-penetrating radar, and extensive coring to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered in the drained basins. Investigators used radiometric dating, microfossil analysis, and soil development to determine whether carbon accumulation rates respond to regional changes in climate, or if they are influenced by local rates of plant succession. Investigators reported depths, adjusted depths, radiocarbon dates, calibrated radiocarbon dates, pollen, microfossils, soil bulk density, total organic carbon (TOC), and other descriptive statistics from the spring and summer seasons of April 2002 through April 2005. Data are in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, TIFF, JPEG, and ArcView Shapefile formats, available via FTP..

TITLE: Global Seasonal Snow Classification System. ABSTRACT: The data file defines a global seasonal snow classification system. Based on the physical properties of the snow (depth, density, thermal conductivity, number of layers, degree of wetting, etc.), the world's seasonal snow covers were divided into six classes, plus classes for water and ice fields. Each class was defined by its physical properties, then empirically related to climate using three variables (precipitation, wind, and air temperature). A vegetation proxy was used for wind data: tall vegetation equals low wind, short vegetation equals high wind. The snow classification data are formatted into an array of integers, each value representing a 0.5-degree latitude by 0.5-degree longitude cell. The data set was developed and tested for the Northern Hemisphere. Results for the Southern Hemisphere are untested and have not been evaluated. The Southern Hemisphere suffers from a reduced density of meteorological data which may well have influenced the quality of the snow classification in that area. Also note that much of Antarctica is inappropriately defined as water (the vegetation data set did not extend that far south). A 0.5- x 0.5-degree land-sea mask could be used to set the Antarctica region to the ice classification if this region is of interest..

TITLE: AFI 02 30_02 - The status of dark septate fungi in Antarctic plant and soil communities - Analysis of fungal cultures, plant and soil samples collected from the northern Antarctic Peninsula region in 2002 2003. ABSTRACT: This study investigated the status of dark septate ("DS") fungi in Antarctic plant and soil communities, with the aim of determining the abundance of DS fungi in plant roots and rhizoids, their taxonomic affinities and their symbiotic status. Abundances of fungal hyphae were recorded in roots and rhizoids, and fungi were isolated and identified. Sequencing of ITS (internal transcribed spacer) regions of rDNA indicated that some isolates share taxonomic affinities with fungi of known symbiotic status. Synthesis experiments assessed the effects of DS fungal isolates, including H. ericae, on the growth and nutrient balance of their host plants. Seeds of Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis were collected for use in ecophysiological experiments..

TITLE: Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: The Environmental Working Group (EWG) was established in June 1995 under the framework of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. In January 1996, the EWG Arctic Climatology Group took on the task of compiling digital data on arctic regions to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic. This work resulted in a set of three atlases on CD-ROM for arctic oceanography, sea ice, and meteorology. The Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.- Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean was developed by specialists from the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan with Russian and U.S. partners. The Atlas consists of separate CD-ROM volumes for winter and summer. More than 1.3 million individual temperature and salinity observations collected from Russian and western drifting stations, ice breakers, and airborne expeditions were used to develop the products contained in the winter atlas. The primary products on the atlas are gridded mean fields for decadal periods (1950s,1960s, 1970s, 1980s) of temperature, salinity, density and dynamic height, Atlantic water layer depth, and temperature and salinity profiles and transects. Note that the original individual observations are not provided on the CD-ROM. The CD-ROMs are in HTML format and are free of charge. NSIDC also distributes the Arctic Climatology Project - EWG Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas and the EWG Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas free of charge.

TITLE: Measurement of time and space structure of atmospheric planetary waves in the polar mesosphere from Scott Base, South Pole Station and collaboration with other countries. ABSTRACT: The regular heating and cooling of the atmosphere drives energetic weather systems near the earth's surface. Some of this energy is propagated upwards into the middle atmosphere in a variety of wave modes, including the regular 12 hour and 24 hour tidal motion. Unlike ocean tides, which are driven by the gravitational forces of the sun and moon, the atmospheric tides are driven by the sun's daily heating of the atmosphere. At this latitude, the lack of solar energy during the winter considerably weakens these tides and the 12 hour component loses its distinctive periodicity. A study of the time and space structure of large scale waves in the polar mesosphere and the nature of these tidal variations, is investigated in a joint collaboration with international co-operative research projects (Russia, USA, Australia, Japan, Canada and UK). Such international co-operation is essential because these tidal and wave structures have a very large scale, much bigger than the Antarctic continent itself, and information is required from research stations spread throughout Antarctica. The waves of interest have periods of 10 hours to 3 days, which includes both inertia-gravity and Rossby wave modes. The spatial scale of the waves is determined from observations at the South Pole and Scott Base (78S). The South Pole observations were made with a Gabry-Perot interferometer - with one being installed at Arrival Heights in January 2002. The instrument measures the temperature and line of sight, wind speeds from atmospheric emissions from an altitude of about 85 - 90 kms during the polar night. The instrument scans around the pole at an elevation of about 30° and therefore provides an estimate of the wave’s zonal wave number. The Scott Base observations were recorded simultaneously with a medium-frequency, partial reflection wind radar that measures the vertical profile of the horizontal wind over Scott Base and therefore provides an estimates of the vertical wave number of the mode. The coherence between the South Pole and Scott Base is a measure of the meridional wave number and extent of the wave. The Scott Base radar cannot measure atmospheric temperature and the South Pole equipment cannot measure altitude so the two experiments are complementary..

TITLE: SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE). ABSTRACT: The SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) is a measurement campaign designed to examine the processes which control polar to mid-latitude stratospheric ozone levels. SOLVE is an Arctic mission which was conducted over the course of the 1999-2000 winter. SOLVE employed aircraft, satellites, and balloons to examine the processes which control polar to mid-latitude stratospheric ozone levels. The mission also acquired correlative measurements needed to validate the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III satellite mission and used these satellite measurements to help quantitatively assess high latitude ozone loss..

TITLE: McMurdo Sound sea ice properties and temperatures. ABSTRACT: Metadata for ice temperatures and ice core properties collected in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica as part of the project "Measurements and Improved Parameterization of the Thermal Conductivity and Heat Flow through First-Year Sea Ice", OPP-0126007* --- The polar oceans' sea-ice cover strongly modifies ocean-atmosphere heat transfer. Most important, the ice cover thermally insulates the ocean, with the sea-ice thermal conductivity determining the magnitude of the heat flow for a given ice temperature gradient. Despite its importance (second only to ice albedo), large-scale sea-ice and climate models currently include overly simplistic parameterizations of the ice thermal conductivity that are likely to contribute significantly to errors in estimating ice production rates. As part of this project and in collaboration with colleagues from Victoria University Wellington in New Zealand, we have completed a set of field measurements in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and Barrow, Alaska, from which the thermal conductivity of first-year sea ice has been derived as a function of ice microstructure, temperature (and temperature gradients), salinity and other environmental parameters. In order to arrive at in-situ, non-destructive estimates of brine volume and salinity, capacitance probes that provide data from which the complex permittivity of sea ice at 50 MHz can be derived have also been frozen in. Based on the permittivity data and laboratory experiments, we have been able to link dielectric properties and in-situ brine volume fractions and salinities. Dielectric mixture modeling and inversion of permittivity data thus allow for non-destructive monitoring of in-situ salinity and thermal property evolution. Analysis of thermistor string data from field sites in Barrow and McMurdo has allowed for a derivation of ice thermal conductivity. In conjunction with the permittivity data and microstructural studies the relative importance of diffusive and convective heat transfer in first-year sea ice has been assessed. Finally, the information gathered as part of this project has been synthesized and led to an improved parameterization scheme of thermal conductivity in large-scale sea ice and climate models. Data provided here have been collected as part of the project "Measurements and Improved Parameterization of the Thermal Conductivity and Heat Flow through First-Year Sea Ice", OPP-0126007* and include measurements of temperature and various ice properties at selected sites in first-year and multiyear sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica in the years 2002-2004. Data from earlier installations of thermistor chains for measurements of ice temperature carried out by the New Zealand team have also been included. Data files are in Microsoft Excel format, with individual worksheets for specific cores or temperature data sets. Detailed information and comments on data sampling location etc. are provided in the files. Ice core data (Filename: MMcoredata_xx.xls): Sea-ice cores were obtained with a 10-cm diameter corer and ice thickness was measured at the site with a tape measure placed alongside the entire length of core. On-site, ice temperature was measured, typically at 5 to 10 cm intervals, by drilling holes (ca. 5 mm) into the center of the core and inserting a temperature probe (precision 0.05 K, accuracy <0.1 K) while covering the core with a light thermal shield. The core was then sawed into 5 to 10 cm segments and core segments were transferred into sealed plastic containers to minimize loss of brine. Salinity of samples was determined with a YSI Model 30 Conductivity sonde (measurement error <0.02 or <1 % of the bulk salinity, whichever is larger). Stable isotope (delta-18-O) measurements were carried out at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, University of Alaska Fairbanks (Dr. M. Wooller). Stable-isotope measurements were performed on a Delta+XL Mass Spectrometer (H2-CO equilibration, measured against VSMOW) at a precision of better than 0.5 ppt (with standard deviation between replicate runs of three samples below 0.4 ppt). Ice temperature data (Filename: XX_tempdata_yyyy_uuu[].xls): Here yyyy is year, and uuu is university; [ ] denotes additional qualifiers in some cases. There are descriptive headers in each file. All measurements were made in landfast first-year ice, except in 2003, where MY in filenames denotes deployment in multiyear ice. Temperature measurements were carried out with thermistors (Omega #44031), wired into a Campbell CR10 data logger (precision better than 0.06 K). An important aspect of the experimental set-up is the mounting of the thermistors. The thermistor arrays (5-10 cm spacing) consisted of a separate wire duct, embedded in a polycarbonate-polyethylene matrix of thermal conductivity somewhat lower than that of ice, with the actual thermistors (embedded in a small glass bead) mounted approximately 5 cm away from the duct on a thin support in direct contact with the ice matrix. Temperatures were calculated from resistivity data based on resistivity-temperature dependence relationships provided by the manufacturer for individual thermistors. Also, where noted in data files, thermistors were calibrated in an ice bath at 0.00 &#730;C before deployment, with a one-point correction of the resultant temperature offset made (typically 0.1 K or less). Positions of thermsitors are recorded in meters, with ice surface at time of deploymeny z = 0 and positive values into ice. Time is recorded as Julian Day of year. As noted in the relevant data file headers, some VUW measurements made use of YSI 55031 thermistors and custom-built loggers (with a temperature precision of better than 1 x 10-4 K). VUW arrays were of a very different design, and thermistors were housed inside thin-walled stainless steel tubes with total thermal conductance closely matched to the ice. A comparison of the different designs of the VUW and UAF arrays is made in Pringle et al. (2007 submitted)..

TITLE: The Reid Isobath Set, Digitized from GEBCO Charts for the Pacific (N&S), Atlantic (N&S), Indian, Arctic and Mediterranean. ABSTRACT: This data set provides a stream of coordinates describing a specific isobath as seen in map view. This differs from the usual arrangement that provides depth at ocean positions and requires intensive contouring. The scheme provides a simple, economical way to put bathymetric contours on maps of various types and scales. To facilitate file handling the world is divided into 8 ocean areas, with the complete set requiring about 6.5 mbytes of storage. The originators (at Scripps) use the data to prepare working maps for the study of global ocean circulation. Maps for publication are still prepared by hand using the working maps as a guide. Typically only one isobath is plotted on a map; when more are plotted, the isobaths are at 2-3 thousand meter intervals. Method of preparation: A. Prepare tracings from each of the 18 GEBCO maps B. Digitize the tracings on a (balky) digitizing tablet C. Convert the x-y digitizing coordinates to latitude and longitude D. Compress the lat-lon positions into an incremental format E. Combine the maps into 8 ocean areas. Known Problem Areas: A. The Pacific around Panama. B. The area off Argentina where Gebcos 512 and 516 overlap. Glitches: We (at Scripps) have plotted all the isobaths dozens of times so we know about all the mistakes. Displayed adjacent isobaths (eg. 1000 and 1500) will occasionally overlap. We really did try to make it perfect, but if you could see what we worked with you would understand why we can live with the mistakes and why we have little intention of fixing any more. Structure: Each ocean area contains one or more of the 5th edition Gebco bathymetry charts and contains 9-19 separate files, each containing a particular isobath. North Pacific -- 502,503,506,507 South Pacific -- 510,511,514,515 North Atlantic -- 501,504,508 South Atlantic -- 512,516 Indian -- portion 505,509,513 Mediterranean -- portion 505 Arctic -- 517 Antarctic -- 518 Unpacking the data: All the data is archived in character form (formatted) and is compressed using a simple incremental scheme. The expansion scheme can be easily gleaned from the fortran subroutine included in the distribution. This subroutine (CONBAT) comes directly from our mapping program 'Lamprey'. Also included is a program (SUBSET) that can make subsets of a larger file based on an input latitude - longitude window..

TITLE: Digital Bathymetric Data Base 5-minute (DBDB5) from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). ABSTRACT: The "Digital Bathymetric Data Base 5 minute" (DBDB5) was assembled by the US Naval Oceanographic Office in the early 1980's from computer interpolation of existing contour maps of ocean basins. It is included in ETOPO2 to fill in a few areas in the Antarctic that are too for south to be covered by the satellite-based bathymetry. Along with several land data bases, DBDB5 was incorporated into a full worldwide 5 minute elevation grid, called ETOPO5. For more information about the ETOPO5 5-minute gridded elevation data see "http:  www.ngdc.noaa.gov mgg global etopo5.HTML". The ETOPO5 data set is superseded by the ETOPO2 2-minute data set (see "http:  www.ngdc.noaa.gov mgg fliers 01mgg04.html" ).

TITLE: Integrated Method to Estimate the Carbon Budget of Forests. ABSTRACT: The integrated method to estimate the carbon budget of forests is a research project of scientists at the European Forest Institute (EFI) and the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla). This project, scheduled from 2001 to 2004, is a part of the Research Programme on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources (SUNARE) coordinated by the Academy of Finland. Background and Objectives: -The importance of forests to atmospheric carbon dioxide and international political climate change processes have created a timely need for reliable and transparent estimates of carbon budgets of forests. -The research objective of this project is to develop a new integrated method for calculating such estimates across Europe. -The expected results will improve the applicability of both forest inventories and eddy covariance measurements in forest carbon studies by improving the most critical uncertainties of these methods. The applicability of forest inventories will be improved by more accurate biomass estimates, integrated soil carbon estimates and demonstrated comparability with other methods. The Integrated Method to be developed will provide a new means to extrapolate eddy covariance results over large regions. [Summary provided by European Forest Institute.].

TITLE: Ice analyses and forecasts for the Arctic, Antarctic, and Great Lakes from the NAVY NOAA Joint Ice Center. ABSTRACT: The NAVY NOAA Joint Ice Center (JIC) produces a global sea ice analysis each week. The Arctic analysis is divided into West and East parts. The West Arctic analysis chart extends from the Canadian Archipelago west to the Laptev Sea; the East Arctic covers the remaining area. The Antarctic analysis is presented on one chart. Ice analyses are primarily prepared from satellite imagery (NOAA's Polar Orbiting Satellites, AVHRR in the visual and infrared bands, and the Defense Meterological Satellite Program's SSM I, passive microwave sensor), ice reconnaissance flight data (radar and visual) and some ship and shore station reports. The JIC regularly exchanges data with other ice centers around the world. Seven-day sea ice forecasts are produced weekly for the Arctic. Thirty-day forecast charts for the Arctic are produced and updated every two weeks. Antarctic forecasts are limited to the shipping season to periods of seven days or less. The JIC produces larger scale analyses of the Alaskan and Great Lakes regions in support of the National Weather Service (NWS) offices in Anchorage and Cleveland. Seasonal Outlooks are prepared about 90 days in advance of the shipping season for the Alaskan North Slope, Baffin Bay David Strait and Western Ross Sea McMurdo Sound regions. The two northern hemisphere outlooks are issued in May and the southern hemisphere outlook is issued in October. A bound volume containing all the weekly Arctic analyses is produced every year (usually available in for the preceeding calendar year) and every other year for the Antarctic (also usually available in June). Also, though JIC is not a data archiving unit (the National Snow and Ice Center Data Center (NSIDC) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) archive some JIC products), JIC has a large holding of TIROS N data for the preceeding decade. The JIC currently telefaxes weekly sea ice analyses and 30-day forecast products to several hundred subscribers. 7-day and shorter range forecasts are normally sent directly to users in the field via AUTODIN message or INMARSAT. Outlooks are mailed except for a summary posted to the POLAR and ARCTIC.LOGISTS bulletin boards maintained by OMNET, initiated in 1990. All JIC products are available free of charge, except users are expected to bear the cost of extraordinary means of communication, such as INMARSAT calls..

TITLE: Near Real-Time SSM I EASE-Grid Daily Global Ice Concentration and Snow Extent. ABSTRACT: The Near Real-Time SSM I EASE-Grid Daily Global Ice Concentration and Snow Extent product (Near Real-Time Ice and Snow Extent, NISE) provides daily, global near real-time maps of sea ice concentrations and snow extent. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) creates the NISE product using passive microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F13 Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I). These data are not suitable for time series, anomalies, or trends analyses. They are meant to provide a best estimate of current ice and snow conditions based on information and algorithms available at the time the data are acquired. Near real-time products are not intended for operational use in assessing sea ice conditions for navigation. Sea ice concentration and snow extent maps are provided in two 25 km azimuthal, equal-area projections: the Southern Hemisphere 25 km low resolution (Sl) and Northern Hemisphere 25 km low resolution (Nl) Equal-Area Scalable Earth-Grids (EASE-Grids). The NISE product is updated daily using the best available data from the past five days. Data are in Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format and browse files are in GIF and HDF formats. HDF-EOS data files are available from 04 May 1995 through the present. Data in both formats are updated daily and are available via FTP..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Cumulative Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. The parameters are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Canadian Wildland Fire Information System - Fire Weather Index. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Wildland Fire Information System, Fire Weather Index, consists of six components that account for the effects of fuel moisture and wind on fire behavior. The first three components are fuel moisture codes and are numerical ratings of the moisture content of litter and other fine fuels, the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth, and the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. The remaining three components are fire behavior indexes which represent the rate of fire spread, the fuel available for combustion, and the frontal fire intensity; their values rise as the fire danger increases. Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) - The FFMC is a numerical rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels. This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and flammability of fine fuel. Duff Moisture Code (DMC) - The DMC is a numerical rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. This code gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material. Drought Code (DC) - The DC is a numerical rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact, organic layers. This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels, and amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs. Initial Spread Index (ISI) - The ISI is a numerical rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It combines the effects of wind and the FFMC on rate of spread without the influence of variable quantities of fuel. Buildup Index (BUI) - The BUI is a numerical rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion that combines the DMC and the DC. Fire Weather Index (FWI) - The FWI is a numerical rating of fire intensity that combines the ISI and the BUI. It is suitable as a general index of fire danger throughout the forested areas of Canada.To provide a numerical rating of relative wildland fire potential on a daily basis, generally from April to October of each year.

TITLE: Sea Ice Edge Location and Extent in the Russian Arctic, 1933-2006. ABSTRACT: The Sea Ice Edge Location and Extent in the Russian Arctic, 1933-2006 data are derived from sea ice charts from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia. Provided here are sea ice edge locations, where identifiable, in each AARI ice chart and monthly and seasonal mean sea ice extents for each of the marginal seas in the Russian Arctic derived from these ice edges. The original AARI charts were constructed primarily to assist operations in the Northern Sea Route. The digital version, from which this data set is derived, is titled Sea Ice Charts of the Russian Arctic in Gridded Format, 1933-2006. Spatial and temporal coverage vary. There is generally a chart every 10 days. However, the early part of the series only covers summer; in later years, coverage is year round. Sea ice edge position is given in decimal degrees (latitude at every degree longitude from about 30° W to 150° W going from west to east) for each of the 2877 ice charts. Landfast ice edge, multiyear ice edge, and pack ice edge data are available. Total ice cover and multiyear ice cover mean sea ice extent data, for each year, month, and marginal sea, is available as well, along with companion error statistic files..

TITLE: Recurring Spring Leads and Landfast Ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, 1993-2004. ABSTRACT: In the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, the most significant sea ice anomalies have occurred in the summer ice extent (Eicken et al. 2006). In addition, there has been a considerable decline in the multiyear ice pack in this region (Eicken et al. 2006). To help understand these anomalies, this data set contains information on recurring spring leads and landfast ice extent in this area. This data set maps and documents the spatial and temporal distribution of recurring leads and landfast ice off the coast of northern Alaska in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (Eicken et al. 2006). The leads data span from 1993 through 2004 and are based on visible and infrared Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data onboard the NOAA 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 satellites. The landfast ice extent data extend from 1996 through 2004 and are based on RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The data are available in a number of formats including ArcGIS geodatabases (.mdb), shapefiles (.shp), ArcGIS grids (.adf), ArcGIS grids in ArcInfo interchange format (.e00), and GeoTIFFs (.tif). Statistics are also provided in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls) and metadata in several formats including XML (.xml), SGML (.sgml), HTML (.html), and ASCII text (.txt). Quick-view browse images in JPEG (.jpg) format are provided for the shapefiles, grids, and GeoTIFFs. Data are available via FTP..

TITLE: State of the Cryosphere. ABSTRACT: The Cryospheric regions, or regions where water is found in solid form, are among the most sensitive to temperature change. Average temperatures in snow and ice-covered areas typically remain below zero Celsius much of the year. Unlike other substances found on Earth, ice and snow exist relatively close to their melting point and frequently change phase from solid to liquid and back again. Consequently, consistent and prolonged warming trends should result in observable changes to the Earth's cryosphere. State of the Cryosphere provides readers with a look at climate variability with regard to snow cover, sea ice, glaciers and the related parameter sea level are discussed. In all cases scientists attempt to monitor both the areal extent and mass of these snow and ice bodies. Certainly areal extent is easier to determine than mass. Various forms of remote sensing, from both aircraft and satellite, allows scientists to look down on surfaces at varying spatial scales and over time to determine if the snow or ice covered area is expanding or contracting. Long-term monitoring includes looking at the areal extent of snow cover and sea ice as well as changes in area and mass of mountain glaciers. In all cases, regardless of parameter or measurement method, the amount of snow and ice have been decreasing over the past several decades..

TITLE: Planktic Foraminifer Census Data from Northwind Ridge Cores PI-88-AR P3, PI-88-AR P7, and PI-88-AR P9, Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: Abstract: The U.S. Geological Survey recovered 9 piston cores from the Northwind Ridge in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean from a cruise of the USCGC Polar Star during 1988. Preliminary analysis of the cores suggests sediments deposited on Northwind Ridge preserve a detailed record of glacial and interglacial cycles for the last few hundred-thousand to one million years. This report includes quantitative data on foraminifers and selected sediment size-fraction data in 98 samples from Northwind Ridge core PI-88AR P3, 51 samples from core PI-88-AR P7 and 117 samples from core PI-88-AR P9.

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Paleocene Mollusc Stable Isotope Data. ABSTRACT: The data consist of oxygen and carbon isotope measurement of carbonate samples microdrilled from sequential growth increments of 2 specimens of the bivalve Camptochlamys alaskensis. The samples were collected by L. Marincovich, Jr., from the Prince Creek Formation at Ocean Point, North Slope, Alaska, Lat. 70.0833N, Long. 151.3667W. At the time of publication (1996), the age of the samples was estimated to be Danian. Late Paleocene high-latitude (80 deg N) Arctic Ocean shallow-marine temperatures are estimated from molluscan d18O time series. Sampling of individual growth increments of two specimens of the bivalve Camptochlamys alaskensis provides a high-resolution record of shell stable isotope composition. The heavy carbon isotopic values of the specimens support a late Paleocene age for the youngest marine beds of the Prince Creek Formation exposed near Ocean Point, Alaska. The oxygen isotopic composition of regional freshwater runoff is estimated from the mean d18O value of two freshwater bivalves collected from approximately coeval fluviatile beds. Over a 30 - 340 range of salinity, values assumed to represent the tolerance of C. alaskensis, the mean annual shallow-marine temperature recorded by these individuals is between 11 deg and 22 deg C. These values could represent maximum estimates of the mean annual temperature because of a possible warm-month bias imposed on the average d18O value by slowing or cessation of growth in winter months. The amplitude of the molluscan d18O time series probably records most of the seasonality in shallow-marine temperature. The annual temperature range indicated is approximately 6 deg C, suggesting very moderate high-latitude marine temperature seasonality during the late Paleocene. Based on analogy with modern Chlamys species, C. alaskensis probably inhabited water depths of 30-50 meters. The seasonal temperature range derived from d18O is therefore likely to be damped relative to the full range of annual sea-surface temperatures. High-resolution sampling of molluscan shell material across inferred growth bands represents an important proxy record of seasonality of marine and freshwater conditions applicable at any latitude. If applied to other regions and time periods, the approach used here would contribute substantially to the paleoclimate record of seasonality..

TITLE: DMSP Operational Linescan System (OLS) Analog Imagery. ABSTRACT: NSIDC archives analog imagery collected by the U. S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). DMSP is a system of near-polar orbiting satellites providing data in optical and microwave spectral bands for operational use by the Air Force. The data are visible-band (0.4 to 0.1 micrometer) and thermal infrared-band (10.5 to 12.5 micrometer) hard-copy positive transparency images. Frequent global coverage (up to four times daily) has proven useful for observing changes in snow and ice boundaries on regional to global scales, as well as for a wide variety of meteorological and cloud studies. DMSP is the only meteorological satellite program to operate visible-band sensors at night. Although collected sporadically, there are large amounts of nighttime imagery, useful for studies of man-made and natural lighting, and for use in lightning occurrence studies. The operational scheme consists of two satellites in near-polar (inclination of 98.7 degrees) sun-synchronous orbits at 450 nautical miles (825 km) altitude. Orbital period is 102 minutes and the equatorial node steps around the equator at 25 degree longitude increments on successive orbits. By use of the two satellites, observations are made at near local noon and midnight, and at dawn and dusk. Each satellite carries an operational linescan system (OLS) which collects data continuously along a cross track scan 1600 nautical miles (3000 km) wide.

TITLE: Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC). ABSTRACT: The climatology provides temperature and salinity data at 1X1 degree intervals for all the earth's oceans, down to a depth of 5500m, at incremental depths identical to those provided in the National Oceanographic Data Center's (NODC) World Ocean Atlas (WOA). This global climatology is the combination of NODC's 1998 world climatology (WOA), the EWG Arctic Ocean Atlas (AOA), and select Canadian data provided by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO). While the NODC data includes the Arctic ocean, the AOA data provides a better description of this region. Neither of these data fields provides a good representation of the Canadian Archipelago region and nearby bays in the winter months. The data from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography allowed us to bridge this data hole. These three data sets were merged using an optimal interpolation routine such that our PHC retains the high quality world description provided by the WOA while improving the Arctic with the AOA fields and Canadian data. In summary, PHC = WOA (Levitus) '98 everywhere except in our arctic domain, where we have blended in the AOA field (from EWG), and the BIO data to produce a more realistic arctic region. These Version 3.0 data were received from the Polar Science Center, Applied Physics Lab., University of Washington, during April 2005..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Seasonal Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. The parameters are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: MODIS Ocean Products. ABSTRACT: The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. It is an optical scanner that views the Earth in 36 channels with spatial resolution ranging from 250 meters to 1 kilometer. MODIS-Aqua Level-2 and Level-3 Ocean Color and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov  Ocean color and SST processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html and at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  SST from MODIS-Terra are available from the Ocean Color Web data archive. For additional information about MODIS ocean data products, see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov PRODUCTS The MODIS-Aqua Level 1A files that are produced, utilized, and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) are subsetted to remove bands and data that are not utilized for Ocean (SST and Ocean Color) product generation. The Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances generated from Level 1A sensor counts and GEO files. Each Level-2 &granule& represents 5 minutes of Terra or Aqua viewing. The ocean color products are only collected in daylight, resulting in 144 granules per day. The sea surface temperature products are collected both day and night, resulting in 288 granules per day. Pixels have 1 km spatial resolution. There are 1354 pixels across the granule, and 2030 rows down the granule. Each Level-2 product is generated from the corresponding Level-1B product. Eleven ocean color parameters and three sea surface temperature parameters are produced. Each pixel also has up to 32 flags and masks that indicate the presence of non-ocean data, algorithm failures and warnings. At Level-3, the products can be generalized into three functional groups: binned 4.6 km, mapped 4.6 km, and mapped 9 km. Level-3 binned products are global products. Spatial bins have 4.63 km spatial resolution in a sinusoidal equal-area grid. Only bins with data values are present; land bins and bins with no data are not stored in the files. All 11 ocean color parameters and three sea surface temperature parameters are available in multiple temporal composites (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Seasonal, Yearly, Cumulative). Each Level-3 binned Ocean Color granule contains only data that have met data quality standards as indicated by the Level-2 flags and masks. SST products can contain data of varying data quality levels, but each bin will only contain the best quality data available for the time period. The Level-3 standard mapped products are global products as well. Grid points for the entire globe are present in the data granules, including fill values for land and unfilled data points. Spatial resolutions of 4.6 and 9.2 km are available. Five ocean color parameters and three sea surface temperature parameters are available in multiple temporal composites (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Seasonal, Yearly, Cumulative). Maps are in an equal-angle latitude-longitude grid (cylindrical equidistant map projection). Additional products are under evaluation (currently fluorescence line height and calcite concentration) and are also available as Level 3 mapped products. See the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD) at http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod22.pdf and http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod23.pdf The following are the MODIS ocean parameters: Parameters 1-6 are normalized water leaving radiances at 412, 443, 488, 531, 551, and 667 nm. These are radiances received at spacecraft altitudes modified principally by solar irradiance scattering and absorption from the air (molecular (Rayleigh) scattering), from particles suspended in the air (aerosol (Mie) scattering), ozone (selective absorption), sea surface reflections (Sun and sky glitter), and finally, from within the ocean, water molecules and dissolved and suspended particles. Derived water-leaving radiances normalized to a constant sun angle, are essential information for the production of most other MODIS ocean products. The MODIS water-leaving radiance algorithm builds upon both CZCS and SeaWiFS algorithms, taking advantage of improvements in the instrument. For more details please see: http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MSL12  Parameter 7 is the chlorophyll-a concentration. The algorithm used is an empirical 3-band formulation (OC3M) developed by O'Reilly et al, based on the maximum ratio of either 443 nm or 488 nm to 551 nm surface reflectance. The coefficients in the formula are based on analysis of the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) ( http:  seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov  ). For more details of the empirical chlorophyll algorithm please see: http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi postlaunch_tech_memo.pl?11 Parameter 8 is the ocean water attenuation coefficient, or diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K490). The summary for parameter 7 is relevant here, as well. Parameters 9-11 are ocean aerosol properties: aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 869 nm (Tau 869), epsilon 748nm 869nm, and angstrom coefficient 531nm 869nm. AOT is a measure of atmospheric aerosol concentration and the effect that they have on the transmission of light. Epsilon is an index describing the two aerosol models selected by the atmospheric correction algorithm. The angstrom coefficient describes the spectral behavior and size distribution of the aerosol particles in the AOT. Sea-surface temperatures are produced as follows: Day using MODIS channels 31 and 32 (11 micron), Night using MODIS channels 31 and 32, and Night using MODIS channels 22 and 23 (4 micron). SST product determination is based on infrared retrievals of ocean temperature which are corrected for atmospheric absorption.

TITLE: Snow and Vegetation Measurements from Selected Sites Near Council, Alaska, USA, 2000-2002. ABSTRACT: A combination of snow depth, snow temperature, snow water equivalent (SWE), and albedo measurements were taken from the spring of 2000 to the fall of 2002 at five sites near Council, Alaska. The sites vary in land cover type from forest to tundra. The purpose of the investigation was to understand the potential effects of climate change on the region by measuring how conditions change along a vegetation gradient. These data, which characterize snow cover and snow-holding capacity of various vegetation types, can help scientists understand how key meteorological events impact the arctic landscape. Data files, available via FTP, are in Excel format and include plots of the data and supplementary data information..

TITLE: Polar Waveform Data Reference Set from Seasat Altimeter Sensor Data Record. ABSTRACT: The PDRS (Polar Data Reference Set) is a subset of the Seasat Altimeter sensor data record (SDR) archive maintained at the ADF (Algorithm Development Facility), part of the EODC (Earth Observation Data Centre). The aim was to provide a manageable set of polar waveforms for R&D analysis. The PDRS covers a 17-day repeat period from 24th July 1978 to 11th August 1978. Seasat was launched on 28th June 1978 carrying a five-sensor payload. The objective of the Altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean topography with a height measurement precision of 10 cm. The ALT carrier frequency was 13.5 GHz and operated in chirp pulse mode with a 3.2 micro-second uncompressed pulse width and 3.125 ns compressed pulse width. The pulse limited footprint diameter was 1.2 km for calm seas; beam-limited footprint diameter was 22.2 km. The PDRS is sub-divided into four data types: i) Antarctic ice sheet data, ii) Antarctic sea ice data, iii) Greenland ice sheet data, and iv) Arctic sea ice data. The source of the PDRS data set was 36 tapes comprising the SDR waveform data for a 17-day repeat period. The data points of interest fall in two distinct geographic regions: south of -50 and north of 59 latitudes. In the southern region, all data with the TOIL flag set to land were extracted as Antarctic ice sheet data. In the northern region, all data with the TOIL flag set to land within Greenland (longitudes -58 W and -20 W) were extracted as Greenland ice sheet data The remaining sets of sea ice data were extracted using an algorithm based on the peakiness of the waveform which was developed by the Remote Sensing Group at Mullard Space Science Laboratories, UK. The tapes are written in 9-track, 6250-bpi format. The block format is that described in the Seast Telemetry dictionary, containing 23 waveforms packed into 2988 2-byte words. Each tape is divided into logical files separated by a file mark, one per source tape. Full tape copies will be made of this data set on request. Tape handling costs will be charged..

TITLE: Canadian Regional Ice Charts. ABSTRACT: These charts show the estimated ice conditions for various regions across Canada. They are based on an analysis and integration of all available data on ice conditions, including weather and oceanographic information, visual observations from shore, ship and aircraft, airborne radar, satellite imagery and climatological information. The charts describe areas of differing ice conditions using the international standard ice code, and indicate where significant changes in the amount, stage of development and form of the predominant ice types have occurred. Charts are issued on a weekly basis during the summer season. During winter months (January - May), the charts are issued on a monthly basis. They cover the east coast, Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, Eastern and Western Arctic.The Canadian Ice Service promotes safe and efficient maritime operations and protects Canada's environment by providing reliable and timely information about ice conditions in Canadian waters.

TITLE: Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry Data for Crude Oils, Condensates and Rock Extracts From Canadian and Selected International Sedimentary Basins. ABSTRACT: This data set includes mass fragmentograms and mass spectra obtained from gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of mainly saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons fractions of crude oils, condensates and rock organic extracts. Distributions of selected classes of compounds are widely used to recognize petroleum genetic relationships (oil-oil, oil-source correlations) and various forms of petroleum alteration (mainly thermal and or biological). The data have been collected using various gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) equipment operating in several experimental modes (mainly selected ion monitoring [SIM], full scan [FS] and multiple reaction monitoring [MRM]). These data have been utilized in petroleum system analysis applied to exploration, petroleum engineering optimization and environmental impacts mitigation in most Canadian and some international sedimentary basins. These data are used in the determination of the geochemical composition of crude oils and rock extracts, biomarker distribution, oil-oil correlation, oil-source correlation, oil alteration, biodegradation, thermal maturation, petroleum system analysis, petroleum source potential, petroleum exploration, energy assessment, environmental geology and petroleum production engineering.

TITLE: SSM I Derived Global Ocean Surface Wind Components V10 (Atlas et al.); Product #079. ABSTRACT: This product is one of several products containing SSM I derived winds over the oceans produced by Robert Atlas and Joseph Ardizzone (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center) in collaboration with Ross N. Hoffman (Atmospheric and Environmental Research - AER). A 2D variational analysis method (VAM) was used to combine information from ECMWF 10m surface wind analyses, SSM I wind speeds (from Frank Wentz, Remote Sensing Systems), and ship and buoy winds to produce new surface wind analyses between -78 and 78 degrees latitude. Data sets designated as level 3.0 contain gridded surface winds produced by the VAM. Level 2.5 data sets contain SSM I wind speeds with wind directions assigned from the VAM analysis. Finally, the level 2.5 data is binned to grid points over 5 and 30 day periods. This is designated as the level 3.5 product. SSM I wind speeds have been assimilated every 6 hours for the period July 1987 to December 1999. Please note that all products were arrived at using Wentz version-2 SSM I. Extensions will be made as SSM I data becomes available. All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s.

TITLE: North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) Oceanographic Mooring Data, 2001-2002. ABSTRACT: This data set, acquired with an oceanographic bottom-anchored mooring, includes sea-ice draft and depth data, conductivity, temperature, pressure, salinity, and ocean current measurements such as speed and direction. Each mooring contains vertically distributed instruments, which measure ocean properties at fixed depths and record data internally. These data are retrieved annually when the mooring is recovered. Located on the Pole Abyssal Plain about 50 kilometers from the North Pole, the 2001 mooring was chosen because it provided a suitable landing site for the supporting aircraft. Ocean depth was approximately 4300 m. Data were recorded half-hourly to hourly from 1 April 2001 through 27 April 2002. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Seasonal Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: CO2, Hydrographic, and Chemical Data Obtained During the R V Meteor Cruise 18 1 in the North Atlantic Ocean, CDIAC NDP056. ABSTRACT: [Summary adopted from the NDP-056 documentation] The North Atlantic Ocean is characterized by an intense meridional circulation cell carrying near-surface waters of tropical and subtropical origin northward and deep waters of arctic and subarctic origin southward. The related "overturning" is driven by the sinking of water masses at high latitudes. The overturning rate and thus the intensity of the meridional transports of mass, heat, and salt, is an important control parameter for the modeling of the ocean's role in climate. Certainly such estimates require more than one survey of the study area; therefore, the Research Vessel (R V) Meteor Cruise 18 1 was one in a series of cruises in the North Atlantic that started in March 1991 and continued until 1995. This data documentation discusses the procedures and methods used to measure total carbon dioxide (TCO2) and total alkalinity (TALK) at hydrographic stations, as well as underway partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) measured during the R V Meteor Cruise 18 1 in the North Atlantic Ocean (Section A1E). Conducted as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the German North Atlantic Overturning Rate Determination expedition, the cruise began in Reykjavik, Iceland, on September 2, 1991, and ended after 24 days at sea in Hamburg, Germany, on September 25. 1991. WOCE Zonal Section A1E began at 60 N and 30(deg)30' W (southeast of Greenland) and continued southeast with a closely spaced series of hydrocasts to 52(deg)20' N and 14(deg)15' W (Porcupine Shelves). Measurements made along WOCE Section A1E included pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen measured by a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensor; bottle salinity; oxygen; phosphate; nitrate; nitrite; silicate; TCO2; TALK; and underway pCO2. A total of 61 CTD casts were made, including 59 bottle casts and 2 calibration stations. Replicate samples from seven Niskin bottles at five stations were also collected for later shoree-based reference analyses of TCO2 by vacuum extraction and manometry and TALK in the laboratory of Dr. Charles D. Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; these results are also included in this report. TCO2 was measured by using an automated sample processsor, to extract CO2 from seawater samples, coupled to a coulometer, to detect the extracted gas. The precision and accuracy of the system was 11.60 umol kg. Samples collected for TALK were measured using standard potentiometric techniques; precision was 12.0 umol.kg. Underway pCO2 was measured by infrared photometry; precision was 12 uatm. The R V Meteor Cruise 18 1 data set is available freee of charge as a numeric data package (NDP) from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. The NDP consists of three oceanographic data files, three FORTRAN 77 data retrieval routine files, an readme file, and this printed documentation, which describes the contents and format of all files as well as the procedures and methods used to obtain the data.

TITLE: Central Asia Temperature and Precipitation Data, 1879-2003. ABSTRACT: This data set updates and expands the NOAA Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) of quality controlled meteorological records, focusing on the Northern Tien Shan and Pamir Mountain Ranges of Central Asia. It is compiled primarily from meteorological measurements conducted by the National Hydrometeorological Services (NHMS) of the Central Asian countries. Precipitation data are monthly sums bias corrected for gauge type and for wetting, but not for wind. The correction factors, K1 for gauge type, K2 for wind, and K3 for wetting, are included as separate files. Temperature data are monthly means, for example, the mean of daily temperatures for that month, where daily temperature is defined as the average of all observations for each calendar day. For many stations, average maximum and average minimum temperature are supplied as well. These are derived from daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The station metadata for this data set are station histories, populat ion, vegetation, and topography. Data were subjected to rigorous quality control and homogenieity assessment procedures, consistent with those used for the GHCN. There are records from 298 stations. The period of record covered by each station is variable, and in the period from 1985 to 1995, there was a sharp reduction in the number of operating stations. The earliest record is from 1879. Records are updated through 2003 where data are available. Most stations have almost 100 years of observations. Records are from stations in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The data are stored as tab-delimited ASCII text format, Microsoft Excel, and PDF, and are availabe via FTP..

TITLE: Upper Colorado River Flow Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of reconstructed annual flows of the Colorado River at Lee Ferry based on new tree-ring records of ring-width from remnant preserved wood. ABSTRACT: New tree-ring records of ring-width from remnant preserved wood are analyzed to extend the record of reconstructed annual flows of the Colorado River at Lee Ferry into the Medieval Climate Anomaly, when epic droughts are hypothesized from other paleoclimatic evidence to have affected various parts of western North America. The most extreme low-frequency feature of the new reconstruction, covering A.D. 762-2005, is a hydrologic drought in the mid-1100s. The drought is characterized by a decrease of more than 15% in mean annual flow averaged over 25 years, and by the absence of high annual flows over a longer period of about six decades. The drought is consistent in timing with dry conditions inferred from tree-ring data in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, but regional differences in intensity emphasize the importance of basin-specific paleoclimatic data in quantifying likely effects of drought on water supply..

TITLE: Organic Iron Speciation in the Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: Objectives The distribution and biological availability of Fe is strongly controlled by its physical-chemical speciation within seawater, where colloids and Fe-organic complexes are dominant factors. In order to study the distribution and the biological availability of Fe, the natural Fe organic complexes over the whole water depth were determined in three different size fractions. Special attention was given in that distinct water masses present were sampled as well. Samples were collected by an ultra-clean sampling system using 24 Go Flo bottles fixed on an all-titanium frame and with a Kevlar cable. The concentration of iron binding ligands (organic compounds which strongly bind Fe) and their binding strength (conditional stability constant) are studied in 3 size classes here: unfiltered water, 0.2 &#956;m filtered water and smaller than 1000 KDa ultra-filtrated water. Methods General Under ultra clean conditions the 0.2 μm filtered seawater was ultra-filtrated using polyethylene hollow-fiber filters as to make an operational defined distinction between large colloidal and small colloidal Fe including the "truly dissolved" Fe (1000 KDa nominal weight, Stereapore, Mitsubishi-rayon Co. Ltd, Nishioka and al., 2000, 2005). The dissolved organic iron (0.2 μm filtered) as well as the truly dissolved iron (< 1000 KDa) were analysed by Maarten Klunder and Patrick Laan using a chemo luminescence method (FIA) with acidified samples (pH 1.8). Total iron will be measured 6-12 months after the acidification of the unfiltered sample. The natural ligand characteristics were determined by doing a complexing ligand titration with addition of iron (between 0 and 8 nM of Fe added) in buffered seawater (mixed NH3 NH4OH borate buffer, 5 mM). The competing ligand 'TAC' (2-(2-Thiazolylazo)-p-cresol) with a final concentration of 10 μM was used and the complex (TAC)2-Fe was measured after equilibration (> 15 h) by cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) (Croot and Johansson, 2000). The electrical signal recorded with this method (nA) was converted as a concentration (nM), then the ligand concentration and the binding strength were estimated using the non-linear regression of the Langmuir isotherm (Gerringa and al., 1995). The voltammetric equipment consisted of a μAutolab potentiostat (Type I, II and III, Ecochemie, The Netherlands), a mercury drop electrode (model VA 663 from Metrohm). All equipment was protected against electrical noise by a current filter (Fortress 750, Best Power). Total and dissolved iron was measured directly on board by Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) after de Jong et al. 1998 in a cleanroom container. Reference M. Klunder (separate data set, see Dissolved_Fe_Arctic_Klunder_IPY35_NL) Sampling statistics 4 deep stations have been sampled in order to characterize and show any difference between 3 basins in the Arctic Ocean: Nansen basins (2950 m and 3935 m), Amundsen basin (4500 m) and Makarov basin (3900 m). 3 shallow stations have also been sampled to show the influence of the river inputs on these basins: Barent Sea (175 m), Kara Sea (310 m) and Laptev Sea (56 m)..

TITLE: IPY-132-CANADA #186-POLAR BIOREM-BIORESTORATION OF CONTAMINATED SOILS AND SEDIMENTS NEAR SCIENTIFIC STATIONS IN POLAR REGIONS. ABSTRACT: PROJECT CANADA #186 FOR IPY: WITH THE COLLABORATION OF FRANCE AND ARGENTINE SCIENTIST Arctic: June 2007 to August 2008 Antarctic: December 2006 to April 2008 Scientific and military stations in polar and sub-polar regions have been and are still dependent on fossil fuels for their unique source of energy. The result has been the accidental contamination of soils surrounding stations mainly by diesel fuel and sometimes the nearby marine ecosystem by small or large oil spills from shipping activities. Furthermore, many stations had burned and often are still burning wastes on the site spreading polyaromatic hydrocarbons and soot in the vicinity of stations. Cleanup and restoration of hydrocarbons contaminated soils are difficult tasks in polar regions due to extreme fragility of soil and nearshore ecosystems, low temperature and limited access to heavy cleanup equipment. The approach now adopted by most countries already active in restoring contaminated sites is to develop "in-situ bioremediation methods" which consist in encouraging natural microbial communities to degrade oil residues and PAHs by adding nutrients or selecting highly performing bacteria collected from these sites. Scientific progress has been important in the last decade, but not enough fast to face the emergency case we are now facing with the fast warm-up of both polar regions. In many cases, water soluble oil and PAHs components (the most toxic ones) have slowly migrated to permafrost level and persisted there. As permafrost layer will go down and eventually disappear in some regions, there is an urgent need to speed up research and development of efficient methods for «biorestoration» of hydrocarbons contaminated soils and sediments in polar stations and transfer these techniques to countries without expertise and financial support in bioremediation technology. Taking the opportunity of the IPY 2007 and the increasing awareness of world population about the importance of preserving and restoring fragile polar environments, we propose to develop a world R&D network on the best technologies to be use in a very near future to biorestore and protect soil and nearby marine ecosystems from fossil fuels and PAHs from on-site burning. Such a network is already partly in place as our team at ISMER (Université du Québec à Rimouski) is working with France (Institut Paul-Émile Victor, IPEV) for over 10 years and with Argentina Antarctic Institute for 4 years. The project will consist in conducting one-year comparative bioremediation experiments in various sites using emerging techniques from participating countries and determining key factors which control the success or the failure of proposed techniques. The final step will be to transfer successful technologies to demanding countries. This project is a world wide extension of ongoing programs on bioremediation and biorestotarion of oiled soils and sediments conducted by France and Argentina in co-operation with a Canadian team. One Canadian PhD student is presently at Juvany station with MacCormack team. Principal Canadian investigator will be at Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in January 2006.In all cases, the Canadian team is responsible for chemical and toxicological analysis. The project includes the settlement of a permanent Canada Argentina laboratory at Esperanza station where two large houses (formally used by officers) are already available for scientific activities around the year. If Argentina provides hosing, electricity, sampling boats and transportation to Ushuaia, the contribution from Canada is expected to provide scientific instruments and sampling means to be permanently present on the station.

The extent and intensity of the contamination will be determining factors to decide were experiments will be conducted. The project will have to locate permafrost level (if any) and estimate any change occurring in present years compared to previous decades. Experiments will be conducted in both Arctic and Antarctic stations in order to compare capacity of local bacterial communities to degrade fossil hydrocarbons under comparable weather conditions. The project will involve "bioaugmentation experiments" using selected bacterial consortia from contaminated sites and their re-introduction at the same site with optimum conditions..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Weekly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Ellesmere Island Paleocene Mollusc Stable Isotope Data. ABSTRACT: The data consist of oxygen and carbon isotope measurement of carbonate samples microdrilled from sequential growth increments of 1 specimen of the bivalve Arctica ovata. The sample was collected by L. Marincovich, Jr., from the Mount Moore Formation of the Eureka Sound Group on Ellesmere Island, Canada. At the time of publication (1996), the age of the sample was estimated to be Danian. This sample is Field No. 84LM14. Abstract Characterizing polar climates during past warm intervals is important for understanding "greenhouse" climate dynamics because high-latitude surface temperatures and precipitation patterns are extremely sensitive to global climatic conditions. Model-data comparisons of high-latitude climates during past warm intervals (Cretaceous-Eocene, Pliocene) are currently at odds. Specifically, simulations of past warm climates produce polar regions characterized by sub-freezing temperatures and significant seasonality, whereas limited fossil proxy data indicate higher mean annual temperatures and low seasonality (i.e. an equable climate). We have constructed a data set to infer northern hemisphere polar marine temperatures during the late Paleocene. Seasonal and mean annual temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation are reconstructed for an Arctic coastal setting during the Thanetian (57-58 Ma) using fossil shell stable isotope profiles. We estimate that coastal water temperatures varied between 10 and 15 degrees C during the seasons of growth, presumably spring, summer and fall. These findings support paleontological evidence, implying Northern Hemisphere polar climates were seasonally warm during the late Paleocene. In addition, estuarine fossil oxygen isotope profiles show periodic excursions to low values (as low as -19 per mil VPDB), which indicate seasonal pulses of isotopically-depleted freshwater..

TITLE: The AVHRR quick-looks service: AVHRR quick-looks from Tromso Satellite Station (Norway) coverage area distributed in near-real time. ABSTRACT: Tromso Satellite Station (TSS) is Norway's national receiving station for data from polar orbiting satellites. TSS location is ideal for reception of data from polar orbiting satellites. The area covered by TSS includes the entire Arctic from West Greenland to the Russian Taymyr peninsula, as well as the Northern part of Europe and larger parts of Russia. Since 1973 Tromso Satellite Station (TSS) has received data from the NOAA satellites. Using the national part of the internet, Uninett, TSS has established a near real-time processing and distribution system for NOAA AVHRR data. Quick looks, raw data set, geo-corrected data sets, SST and weather images are available for near real-time delivery to customers in Norway and other countries that can be reached using Internet or ISDN. The processing and distribution time for these products are typically 1-3 hours. The AVHRR data for the entire coverage area of TSS is also stored on optical disks. This archive is a part of the ESA TIROS Co-ordinated Network. The NOAA AVHRR QL Service service is based on WWW or FTP and the quick-looks are a view of a whole pass, with the data resampled to a spatial resolution of 3 km..

TITLE: North American Bird Banding Summary Retrieval File. ABSTRACT: [For a more detailed metadata record, see: "http:  gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov brd brd_birdband.html"] The Banding Retrieval File contains summarized records for data through the last full calendar year for all game birds banded since 1908, and for all nongame birds banded since 1954. A summary record includes all birds of the same species, age and sex, with the same status and additional information codes, banded under the same permit number, within the same region and 10-minute block of latitude and longitude, during the same month and 5-day banding period, the same band type, and band number prefix. The Banding Retrieval File contains over 9 million records representing over 50 million birds processed through August 1995. The file increases by approximately 1.2 million birds each year. Data are displayed in the following order: species number, region, year, permit, month, day code, status and additional information, age, sex, latitude, longitude, direction code, prefix and part of band suffix, total number of birds. A file format is included with all disks to assist the user in separating the fields. Listings have the fields separated and identified. The numerical codes in the data can be translated with the aid of the Bird Banding Manual, vol. 1 part 5. Status code in the first column indicates that something was done to the bird upon recapture that changed the orginal status. Includes range of North American species. Range includes breeding, wintering and migration locations. Wintering ranges can include South America, Africa, Europe. Breeding can occur as far north as the Arctic. However, the species being studied are North American species. Data and software tools to analyze the bird banding data can be obtained from the anonymous ftp site:.

TITLE: Surface Radiation Measurements at the Koldewey Ground Station (Arctica). ABSTRACT: Daily averaged radiation data are available from 31 July 1992. Since 1992 surface radiation measurements have been carried out by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) at Koldewey Station in the framework of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in cooperation with the Norsk Polarinstitutt. The radiation signals are taken in one minute intervals and stored as averages over 5 minutes. They include: - global radiation (pyranometer CM11, Kipp+Zonen), - reflected solar radiation (pyranometer CM11, Kipp+Zonen), - diffuse sky radiation (pyranometer CM11, Kipp+Zonen), - direct solar radiation (NIP, Eppley mounted on a sun tracker), - OG1 (global>530nm, pyranometer CM11, Kipp+Zonen), - RG8 (global>695nm, pyranometer CM11, Kipp+Zonen), - UV (300-370nm, TUVR, Eppley), - sunshine duration (Solar 111, Haenni), - downward long-wave radiation (pyrgeometer Eppley), - upward long-wave radiation (pyrgeometer Eppley). The pyranometers and pyrgeometers are ventilated with slightly preheated air to minimize hoar frost problems and zero offsets during cloudless and windless conditions. The instruments were maintained continuously several times per day throughout the year. After one year of operation they are re-calibrated at the German Weather Bureau according the World Radiometric Reference (WRR). At AWI, the radiation measurements - averaged over 5 minutes - are archived together with the data from the mast measurements, daily upper air soundings and routine synoptic surface observations in a relational database (SYBASE). Additionally some derived quantities (Iqbal 1983) such as the solar elevation, extraterrestrial solar insolation, astronomical sunshine duration are available. In order to obtain daily averaged radiation data, each day was subdivided into eight 3-hourly intervals (0-3, 3-6, ..., 21-24 UTC). For each 3-hourly interval an average was derived irrespective of the number of measurements. This procedure was chosen in order to minimize problems resulting from missing values. If one or more 3-hourly averages were missing, no daily average was calculated. Data are accessible via Web network by means of the AWI-Home-Page, 'http:  www.awi-bremerhaven.de', and can be obtained from AWI after prior consultation..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Yearly Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: The North American Breeding Bird Survey Results and Analysis, 1966-2005. ABSTRACT: The Breeding Bird Survey is a source of information about distributions and population changes of North American birds. It is also a tool for learning about birds, with with connections to the ID tips with pictures of common North American birds and quizzes on bird distribution and identification. The BBS is a large-scale survey of North American birds. It is a roadside survey, primarily covering the continental United States and southern Canada, although survey routes have recently been initiated in Alaska and northern Mexico. The BBS was started in 1966, and the over 3,500 routes are surveyed in June by experienced birders. The primary objective of the BBS has been the estimation of population change for songbirds. However, the data have many potential uses, and investigators have used the data to address a variety of research and management objectives. On the Home Page, we summarize results from the BBS, and supplement the results with pictures of birds and other species information..

TITLE: MODIS Terra Snow Cover 8-Day L3 Global 500m ISIN Grid V003. ABSTRACT: Snow cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) include level 2 swath data and level 3 gridded daily and eight-day composites, at 500 m resolution. A snow mapping algorithm, based on the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other criteria tests, is used to process MODIS data. The eight day level 3 product (MOD10A23) contains fields for maximum snow cover extent over an eight day compositing period, and a chronology of snow occurrence observations. This 500 m product consists of 1200 km by 1200 km tiles of data gridded in an integerized sinusoidal map projection. Snow cover data and supporting attributes are in HDF-EOS format, and are available by ftp. This data set represents Version 3 (V003) of the MODIS processing scheme. The V003 collection contains reprocessed V001 data from 5 March 2001 onward and V003 data from 24 May 2001 onward. V003 data contain processing refinements accommodating algorithm, instrument and calibration stabilization. V003 start dates will continually shift to earlier dates as V001 data are reprocessed to V003. After V003 data are generated for a given day, the V001 data for the same day will still be available for ordering through the EOS Data Gateway (EDG) for at least six months. Eventually, V003 data will completely replace V001 data..

TITLE: S. Forward Sortation Areas Cartographic Boundary File, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The 2001 Census Forward Sortation Areas Cartographic Boundary File is available as a standard package for Canada. It depicts forward sortation area (FSA) boundaries derived from postal codes captured from the 2001 Census questionnaires. Through analysis of the postal codes reported by census households, a single FSA was assigned to each dissemination area (most often the FSA reported by the largest number of census households). FSA polygons were formed by grouping dissemination areas. Therefore, the Census based FSA boundaries are not equivalent to FSA boundaries in use by Canada Post, but are representations created from dissemination areas. Catalogue number: 92F0170XCE ...for additional information visit our organization's website.The 2001 Census Forward Sortation Areas Cartographic Boundary File product is released as a geographic reference tool for 2001 Census data, providing a spatial representation of Forward Sortation Areas as reported by Census respondents. The product, in conjunction with Statistics Canada data, can be used for applications such as site location analysis, planning of service delivery and various types of data analysis and mapping.

TITLE: Pakitsoq Greenland Ice Methane Carbon Isotope Data. ABSTRACT: d13CH4 in air dating between 11,360 and 12,220 years before the present was measured in ice samples from the Pakitsoq outcrop (Western Greenland). The record covers the transition between the Younger Dryas (YD) and Preboreal Holocene (PB), when temperature and CH4 increased rapidly at the termination of the last ice age. A total of 82 ice samples from Pakitsoq were analyzed for d13CH4 of enclosed air. The estimated range in age per sample is ca. 25 - 35 yr, which includes both sample thickness and gas age distribution due to diffusion and bubble enclosure. For replicate measurements (multiple ice samples of equal age) we report mean values with standard errors. For single measurements we show analytical precision as derived from the standard ice measurements during that measurement period. Several kinds of visible post-depositional features in the ice, such as fractures, layers or occlusions of dust, as well as certain bubble free bands, were associated with anomalously high values for both [CH4] and d13CH4, compared to surrounding unaffected samples. 11 samples were rejected from the final data set for this reason. Pakitsoq age scale The gas age scale used for assigning dates according to location in the sample profile is derived by comparison of three geochemical records from Pakitsoq and GISP2. Start and end points of prominent fluctuations in d15N, CH4, and d18Oice observed in Pakitsoq were matched with corresponding events recorded in GISP2. The tie points are: (i) the start and peak of the end-of-YD d15N increase; (ii) the start and end of the Allerod - YD CH4 decline; (iii) the d18Oice minimum during the intra-Allerod cold period; and (iv) the d18Oice drop into the YD and rise into the PB. The corresponding ages of the GISP2 age scale were corrected by -80 yr to match the date of 11,570 yrBP for the end-of-YD event derived from tree ring ages and assigned to the Pakitsoq inflection points as fixed ages. Between these dates, which are apart by 500 yr at the most, age was interpolated linearly. ABSTRACT: We report atmospheric methane carbon isotope ratios (d13CH4) from the Western Greenland ice margin spanning the Younger Dryas-to-Preboreal (YD-PB) transition. Over the recorded ~800 years, d13CH4 was around -46 per mil; that is, ~1 per mil higher than in the modern atmosphere and ~5.5 per mil higher than would be expected from budgets without 13C-rich anthropogenic emissions. This requires higher natural 13C-rich emissions or stronger sink fractionation than conventionally assumed. Constant d13CH4 during the rise in methane concentration at the YD-PB transition is consistent with additional emissions from tropical wetlands, or aerobic plant CH4 production, or with a multisource scenario. A marine clathrate source is unlikely..

TITLE: Landslide Disasters in Canada 1840-1999. ABSTRACT: Landslide Disasters in Canada is a data base of significant landslide disasters in Canada during the years of 1840-1999, a period of 160 years (Evans, 1997; 1999). Life loss is adopted as the sole criterion for defining a landslide disaster in the Canadian context (Evans, 1997). In this initial attempt at a verified list for Canada, a landslide disaster is defined as a landslide event, or related geotechnical failure, that directly or indirectly results in at least three deaths. This criterion is to a large extent arbitrary but appears to approximate a Canadian disaster reporting threshold. For present purposes, the definition does not include a consideration of the costs of material damage.The Landslide Disasters in Canada database was assembled in collaboration with Emergency Preparedness Canada as a Canadian Contribution to the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). z39.50s:  rgsc1.rgsc.nrcan.gc.ca:9999 LandslidePhotos_fr Spatial Data Organization Information - Indirect Spatial Reference: Direct Spatial Reference: Raster Object Type: Row Count: Column Count: Vertical Count: Spatial Reference Information - Horizontal Coordinate System Definition - Planar - Planar Coordinate Encoding Method: Coordinate Representation: Abscissa Resolution: Ordinate Resolution: Distance and Bearing Representation: Distance Resolution: Bearing Resolution: Bearing Units: Bearing Reference Direction: Bearing Reference Meridian: Planar Distance Units: Geodetic Model: Horizontal Datum Name: Ellipsoid Name: Semi-major Axis: Denominator of Flattening Ratio:.

TITLE: Coastal Video Surveys, Arctic and Atlantic Canada and the Queen Charlotte Islands. ABSTRACT: This data set is part of a large inventory of more than 9,000 km of aerial oblique coastal video coverage of Arctic and Atlantic Canada including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the west and south coasts of Newfoundland, part of Labrador and Hudson Bay, the Queen Charlotte Islands, various Arctic islands and the shores of the Beaufort Sea in the western Arctic. The video was shot from an aircraft, usually a helicopter, flying at an elevation of about 150 m and about 0.5 km or less from shore. Narration on the tapes includes a description of the coastal geology, place names and some interpretation of coastal processes. Many of the videos have been released through the GSC Open File system and these are accompanied by descriptive reports that include maps showing the details of the coverage. Other videos in the collection focus on seabed features and processes.The videos provide reconnaissance level information on coastal geology and features that can be used in a wide variety of applications including coastal zone management and coastal process studies. They provide a reference for mapping of shoreline types and sediment characteristics and can be used in marine oil spill contingency planning.

TITLE: Daily Vertical Profiles of Atmospheric Aerosol Loading and Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) in Antarctica using a LIDAR System. ABSTRACT: The format of this daily data set follows the File Format Specifications NASA-AMES used in many international campaigns on atmospheric soundings. Each data set is identified by SS followed by the date (i.e. SS010289 represents the data set of February 1st, 1989). Primary variables are the vertical profiles of the following parameters: - Squared Range corrected Lidar Signal (Pr2) - Aerosol Backscattering and Scattering Ratio by Lidar - Depolarisation ratio by Lidar (if available) - Pressure,Temperature and Humidity by Rawinsonde (if available) - O3 by Ozonesonde (if available) The Depolarization Backscattering Lidar (DBL) is part of a more complex DIAL System by a scientific cooperation between Service d'Aeronomie of CNRS (France) and IROE of CNR (Italy). Rawin- and Ozone-sonde are by Dumont d'Urville French Antarctic Station. All the profiles are normalized to the same altitudes. The profiles range are typically 5000-30000 m. The altitude resolutions are 30 or 75 m. A set of "auxiliary variables" preceed each group of profiles. They are: - Number of altitudes of the profiles - Date and Time,Averaging Time of the Lidar measure - Laser emission wavelength - Number of the integrated Lidar shots - Date and Time of the Rawinsonde launch (if available) - Latitude and Longitude - Coefficients for Extinction computing - Integrated Backscattering,Optical Depth with bottom and top edge - Telescope Field of View - Bandwidth of the interference filter A description header in the data set contains further details. A suitable processing routine by IROE computes the lidar profiles by row lidar signals that are not directly useful for scientific purposes. Studies on the stratospheric aerosol loading are very important for a better understanding of the physical and chemical phenomena strictly linked to the Ozone Hole in Antarctica.

TITLE: Canada Basin Ocean 1 Infauna CCGC Louis S. St. Laurent 2002-23. ABSTRACT: This dataset investigates the macro- and megabenthos of the Canada Basin, which is one of the biologically least known areas of the Arctic deep sea. Macro-infauna was collected with 11 box cores at six stations ranging from 640 to 3,250 m water depth. Total abundance ranged from 3 to 265 individuals 0.04 square meters (756,625 individuals per square meters) and decreased with increasing depth. Biomass ranged from 0.04 to 228 mg wet weight 0.04 m2 (15,700 mg wet weight per square meter) and followed the same trend. Polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves dominated the faunal densities, biomass and species numbers. A total of 90 benthic invertebrate species taxa (including 15 identified from under-water imager), not part of this data set) from four biogeographic affinities were identified, including at least three new species of Isopoda. The evident low abundances and biomass are in agreement with findings from the Eurasian Arctic deep sea. This dataset exist in Excel format, and presents the foundation for a scientific publication by Bluhm et al (2005). To assess species composition, abundance and distribution of the infauna of the Arctic Canada Basin..

TITLE: Physical, chemical and biological characteristics of soils from the upper Garwood Valley, Ross Sea Region, 2002-2006.. ABSTRACT: These data consist of a number of subsets of soil samples gathered from the upper Garwood Valley in January 2002, January 2003, January 2005 and January 2006. Replicate randomly-located samples of surface soils to 10 cm depth have been gathered from the most common landforms in the area. Within the most widespread landforms, the same type of samples have been gathered along transects of increasing distance from Lake Colleen in the valley's centre. A third subset relates to soils on an experimental site at which the biotic response to additional of local biotic detritus (algal mat and lakeshore foams). For each soil sample, field and later lab-based measurements include: bulk density, texture, repeated measurements of moisture content and temperature at depths of 1 cm and 5 cm, organic carbon (after acidification to remove carbonates) and total nitrogen by Carlo Erba elemental analyzer, ammonium and nitrate (in KCl extraction) by TRAACS auto-analyzer, chlorophyll concentration, field CO2 flux at ambient temperature at the soil surface by LiCor 6400, lab CO2 flux at controlled (and varied) temperature and moisture by LiCor 6400, and lab CO2 fluxes after addition of carbon and nitrogen at controlled temperature and moisture by LiCor 6400. Results indicate relatively high rates of soil respiration and thus turnover of the soil carbon pool, and possible limitations by both carbon and nitrogen under different conditions. Subsamples of soil samples have been stored at -80C for future analysis of microbial diversity using DNA and RNA probing techniques..

TITLE: The response of sea ice and brine water algae and bacteria to changes in salinity, temperature, light and UVB in Terra Nova Bay. ABSTRACT: Samples of the bottom ice algae and brine algae (within 30cm of the top of the ice) were subjected to temperature, salinity, light and UVB experiments and analysed with PAM rapid light curves to determine the response of the algae to changes they will encounter during the processes of ice formation at the start of winter and ice melting in summer. Brine algae are likely to be adapted to high light and high UVB conditions near the surface of the ice and may have produced higher levels of protective pigments, MAA's, therefore the content of MAA's was analysed. Imaging PAM fluorometry was also used to gain a 3D image of photosynthetic stressors during the process of ice freeze and thaw on both algae and bacterial cells. The difference in thylakoid structure with increase in temperature was also analysed. Bacterial cells were collected at the end of exposure and a CTC assay was performed on them to determine the effect of UVB radiation. Bottom ice algae exposed to different light levels and UV exposure was analysed for cell counts, antioxidants and MAAs. Bacterial response to changes in light and salinity was examined by adding a fluorescent stain (CTC) to a melted entire sea ice core, a brine sample and a bottom ice sample and exposing the samples to various combinations of light and salinity. Samples were examined for cells that fluoresce due to metabolized CTC. The bacterial response to light and the presence absence inhibition of microalgae was examined using the vital stain and probe technique after exposing melted ice core samples to a range of irradiances for 4 hours. Samples of the brine community were collected and incubated for 5 days to determine the longer term response to light. Tritiated leucine was used calibrate the use of the CTC method..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua and SeaWiFS Level 3 9KM Monthly Merged Chlorophyll Product. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of merged satellite measurements of global ocean chlorophyll data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform, and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWIFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). MODIS Aqua processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html . SeaWiFS processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html . The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level-3 9 km merged chlorophyll products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods once the refined products for each of the contributing missions are processed. Increased coverage over the single mission product is realized through the merging of the two data sets. There is a substantial improvement (> 50%) in coverage at the daily level, decreasing with the increase in the temporal period binned. The MODIS SeaWiFS merged product is generated in essentially two steps. First, the MODIS Level-3 file is reduced in resolution from 4 to 9 km to match the global resolution of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll product. This involves combining the sum and sum squared field values for the (typically) four 4 km bins into the corresponding single 9 km bin. In the second step, the reduced-resolution MODIS file and the corresponding SeaWiFS Level-3 file are combined. Because both input files are at the same 9 km resolution, the summing is performed bin-by-bin. The Standard Mapped Image file that is generated from the merged Level-3 binned file stores scaled 16 bit integer values rather than the usual 8 bit values, giving the user much greater numerical precision. The actual images displayed on the Ocean Color website in PNG format are provided for visual inspection only. Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level 3 Merged Chlorophyll data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov Merged .

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The Beringian Seabird Colony Catalog is a computerized, GIS-based database, maintained by the Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in anchorage, Alaska. It contains the locations and names of seabird breeding colonies in Alaska (AK) and Russia (RU), the species of birds that nest in each colony, and the numbers of each species. The colony number consists of a map number and a site number. Map number (1 - 153) refers to a USGS 1:250,000 quadrangle, which is not the same as official USGS map number. A site number refers to a specific colony and is not duplicated within the quadrangle. The site name is derived from an official name on USGS map, if one exists; otherwise a descriptive name was invented. PURPOSE: We count birds in some colonies (or in parts of the colonies) each summer. This tells us whether the birds' populations are healthy. If a population is getting smaller, we study it and try to learn what the problem is. In the area that was affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, we study seabirds to learn whether they are recovering from the oil. We count the birds in winter and summer. We study how many eggs the birds lay and how many young birds they raise each summer. We also study how they find their food at sea. We work with observer programs to learn how many birds are caught in fishing gear. This tells us whether seabird breeding populations are impacted by fisheries bycatch.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Climatology Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L555) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T865) -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm, for atmospheric correction (A510) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: NASA SCP Arctic and Antarctic Ice Extent from QuikSCAT, 1999-2004. ABSTRACT: This data set provides sea ice extent for the Arctic (60-90N) and Antarctic (52-90S) in Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) binary image format, along with ASCII text files containing latitude and longitude coordinates along the sea ice edge, and browse images of SIR files in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. Ancillary products include daily-averaged total sea ice extent (km**2) in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999 to 31 December 2004. QuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter (sigma-0) measurements, called 'slices,' for each footprint as it scans over a 1800 km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements of the slices are called 'egg' measurements. The effective resolution and shape of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for each day. The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence, and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images. The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km. Data and browse images are available via FTP, along with C, Fortran, and Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools to read and display the SIR images..

TITLE: West Siberian Lowland Peatland GIS Data Collection. ABSTRACT: This dataset contains the West Siberian Lowland (WSL) peatland GIS data collection. The collection covers the entire West Siberian lowland and was compiled from a wide array of data under the auspices of the NSF-funded "Sensitivity of the West Siberian Lowland to Past and Present Climate" project (Smith et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2004). Detailed physical characteristics of 9,691 individual peatlands (patches) were obtained from previously unpublished Russian field and ancillary map data, previously published depth measurements, and field depth and core measurements taken throughout the region during field campaigns in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The data collection features eight layers containing the detailed peatland inventory, political, and hydrographic information. Point data consist of field and laboratory measurements of peat depth, ash content, and bulk density. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), grant number NSF-9818496..

TITLE: North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) Weather and Radiation Buoy Data, 2002-2004. ABSTRACT: This data set includes in situ air pressure, wind, temperature, longwave radiation, and shortwave radiation measurements. Data were recorded from 27 April 2002 through 24 April 2004 by weather stations and radiometers on drifting buoys near the North Pole that were deployed by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). A lack of solar energy, which is needed to power the radiometer batteries, rendered some data useless after mid-to-late September. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year. More information about the project is available at the NPEO project Web site, http:  psc.apl.washington.edu northpole . Data are in ASCII text format and are available via FTP..

TITLE: NODC World Ocean Atlas 1994: CD-ROMs and Publications. ABSTRACT: The Ocean Climate Laboratory of NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) has completed the multivolume World Ocean Atlas 1994 and technical reports describing the data quality control and processing procedures. The atlas contains historical in situ temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate data, and global, objectively analyzed fields of these parameters on a one-degree latitude-longitude grid for selected standard depth levels from the sea surface to 5500 m depth. The atlas volumes include global distributions of these measured parameters as well as the derived quantities of oxygen saturation and Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU). The philosophy of this project is to produce a hierarchy of documented, value-added data sets and products so that investigators can use these data sets and products with an understanding of how the data have been analyzed and processed, and process the data using different methods if desired. The atlas data sets are also available on CD-ROM and Exabyte tape. The tape version is primarily for research scientists using workstations having sufficient computing power to handle large files. The set of 9 CD-ROMs contain the global objectively analyzed one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each parameter as well as the observed profile data and the interpolated standard depth level profile data. Quality control flags also exist in the data. See References for the quality control documentation. The ocean profile data are organized geographically on CD-ROM and by instrument type on Exabyte tape. The World Ocean Atlas 1994 represents an extension and continuation of the 1982 Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean. Since 1982, a great number of additional oceanographic profiles have accumulated in the archives. In particular, substantial numbers of older historical data have been submitted to the NODC. In addition, data gathered as a result of the NODC's National Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue (NODAR) and the IOC IODE Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue (GODAR) projects were included in this study. NODAR and GODAR seek to catalog and digitize data available only in manuscript or analog form. The World Ocean Atlas was prepared by Sydney Levitus, Timothy Boyer, Russell Burgett, and Margarita Conkright of the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC). Annual,seasonal and monthly means are available. The multivolume World Ocean Atlas 1994 publications present global, objectively analyzed fields of major ocean parameters on a one-degree latitude-longitude grid for selected standard depth levels from the sea surface to 5500 m depth. Produced by the NODC Ocean Climate Laboratory, the atlases present analyses of temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate data. Two technical reports describing the data analysis and quality control procedures are also available. The gridded, objectively analyzed fields and the ocean profile data from which they were derived are available on a set of 10 CD-ROMs. World Ocean Atlas 1994 and the atlas data sets on CD-ROM were produced from the NODCs data holdings as of the first quarter of 1993. The atlas volumes are: Volume 1: Nutrients (NOAA Atlas NESDIS 1, 162 pp.); Volume 2: Oxygen (NOAA Atlas NESDIS 2, 202 pp.); Volume 3: Salinity (NOAA Atlas NESDIS 3, 111 pp.); Volume 4: Temperature (NOAA Atlas NESDIS 4, 129 pp.); Volume 5: Interannual Variability of Upper Ocean Thermal Structure (NOAA Atlas NESDIS 5, 176 pp.); Technical Report 79: Quality Control and Processing of Historical Oceanographic Nutrient Data; Technical Report 81: Quality Control and Processing of Historical Oceanographic Temperature, Salinity, and Oxygen Data. The set of CD-ROMs holds data sets issued along with the multivolume World Ocean Atlas 1994 produced by the NODC Ocean Climate Laboratory. The CD-ROMs contain both the global, objectively analyzed, gridded data sets of major ocean parameters and the observed level and standard level ocean profile data sets from which they were derived, as well as a data set of 5-degree square statistics that give means, standard deviations, and numbers of observations. The contents of the individual discs in this set are as follows: Disc 1 - Objectively analyzed temperature fields; Disc 2 - Objectively analyzed salinity fields and Five-degree square statistics; Disc 3 - Objectively analyzed oxygen, apparent oxygen utilization, oxygen saturation, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate fields; Disc 4 - Observed level profile data for the North Atlantic (0-40N), North Indian and South Indian Oceans; Disc 5 - Observed level profile data for the North Atlantic (40N-90N), and South Atlantic Oceans; Disc 6 - Observed level profile data for the North Pacific (0-30N), South Pacific Oceans; Disc 7 - Observed level profile data for the North Pacific (30N-90N) Ocean; Disc 8 - Standard level profile data for the North Pacific (30N-90N) Ocean; Disc 9 - Standard level profile data for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; Disc 10 - Interannual variability of upper ocean thermal structure; Disc 11 - Replacement CTD data. The CD-ROMs are accompanied by a 3.5-inch diskette that provides documentation and sample programs (source code) for reading the gridded data sets.

TITLE: Copepod species composition and associated chlorophyll data from Resolute Passage (OBIS Canada). ABSTRACT: This dataset includes data collected from the ice station set up in Resolute Passage, 74 degrees 40'N and 94 degrees 54'W between the years 1983 to 1989. Plankton samples were collected using a 1 2m ring net with 100-200u mesh towed vertically from approximately 2 metres off the bottom to the surface. The samples collected were preserved in 4% formaldehyde and later analysed for species stage composition for the dominant copepod taxa: Pseudocalanus, Metridia, Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis, Oithona, Oncaea, Microcalanus. All other species of copepods were lumped together into the category 'other'. Associated chlorophyll and phaeophytin data are available. The associated nutrient data was of poor quality and not archived. To investigate the plankton community structure and establish a baseline to monitor ecosystem changes in the Arctic. Purpose: These data are for display on the OBIS portal and associated mapping programs and for download to personal computers for ad-hoc end-user analysis.

TITLE: Permafrost Water Ice Chemistry in Russia. ABSTRACT: This data set is comprised of water and ice chemistry parameters from areas of massive ground ice in Kolguev Island and Svalbard in the west to Chukotka Peninsula in the east. Water, snow, and ice from different sources (e.g., lakes, rain, atmospheric precipitation, snow, snow patches, modern glaciers, lake ice, ground ice of different origin) were tested, as well as the enclosing deposits. Routine chemical analysis of ion composition, microelement (rare earth elements) analyses, and stable isotopes composition (O-18, D, C-13, S-34) were carried out. Microbal activity was determined. Ice petrography was studied with photos. Video-, photo- and topographic surveys of the study sections were undertaken..

TITLE: Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement II (POAM II) Data at NRL. ABSTRACT: The Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement II (POAM II) instrument was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, aerosol extinction, and temperature. POAM II measures solar extinction in nine narrow band channels, covering the spectral range from approximately 350 to 1060 nm. POAM II was launched aboard the French SPOT-3 satellite on 26 september, 1993 into a Sun synchronous polar orbit. The POAM II mission was interrupted by the failure of the SPOT-3 satellite in November of 1996. The POAM II retrieval version 6.0 includes the following profile data: (1) Ozone concentration, 15-50 km (2) NO2 concentration, 20-40 km (3) Aerosol extinction at 1060 nm, 10-30 km (4) UKMO temperature, pressure, and potential vorticity, 0-60 km The ancillary profiles of temperature, pressure, and potential vorticity from the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) have been interpolated to the location and time of the POAM II measurements. The MSISE-90 model has been used to extend these profiles above the top UKMO pressure level. POAM II data are available through anonymous FTP from ftp:  poamb.nrl.navy.mil pub poam2 .

TITLE: GRIP Ice Core Beryllium 10 Data, 386,000 years. ABSTRACT: GRIP Ice Core Beryllium 10 Data These data were measured at 2 different accelerators located in Zurich and Gif-sur-Yvette. In addition, as explained in Yiou et al., the samples were prepared using 2 different filters (0.45 and 40 microns). During the glacial period, approximately 20% of the total Be-10 was retained on the 0.45 micron filters. This means that, in order to combine the data, it is either necessary to also analyze the 0.45 filters, or make an estimate of their contribution when they are not measured. In addition to the results in Yiou et al., the table includes additional results published Wagner at al. 1997 and Baumgartner et al. 2001. Abstract from Yiou (1997): Concentrations of the cosmogenic isotope 10Be have been measured in more than 1350 samples from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice core drilled at Summit, Greenland. Although a dust-associated component of 10Be retained by 0.45 micron filters in some of the samples complicates the interpretations, the results confirm that the first-order origin of 10Be concentration variations is changes in precipitation rate associated with different climate regimes. This effect is seen not only between glacial and interglacial periods, but also during the shorter "Dansgaard-Oeschger" interstadials. By contrast, the 10Be data do not support the interpretation of rapidly varying accumulation (i.e. climate) during the last interglacial. They can, however, be used to help place limits on the origin of the ice in these events. After taking into account variable snow accumulation effects, variations in the 10Be flux are observed, probably caused by solar and geomagnetic modulation, but possibly also by primary cosmic ray variations. The most dramatic is a 10Be peak ~40,000 years ago, similar to that found in the Vostok Ice Core, thus permitting a very precise correlation between climate records from Arctic and Antarctic ice cores. The 36Cl 10Be ratio (considering either "total" or only ice-associated 10Be) shows significant variability over the whole core depth, thus confirming the difficulty in using this parameter for "dating" ice cores..

TITLE: Maiana Atoll Isotope (delta 18O, delta 13C) Data for 1840 to 1995. ABSTRACT: Maiana bimonthly oxygen isotopic composition, 1840-1995. Notes on the data: File includes columns for Year AD (bimonthly resolution = dec jan, feb mar) and coral d18O (a). The coral used in this study grew (and still does grow) at Maiana Atoll, Republic of Kiribati (1N, 173E). The colony lies at a depth of ~6m (low tide) and is about 4m in height. Annual growth rate is roughly 11mm yr. Methods: Sampling and isotopic analysis: Cores (8.5 cm diameter) drilled from living coral colonies were slabbed and X-rayed to identify annual density bands and optimal sampling transects. Samples were drilled along the growth axis continuously at 1mm resolution. Stable isotopic analysis (d18O and d13C) of powdered samples was performed on a Micromass Optima with Isocarb automated preparation system at the University of Colorado's Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research. Analytical precision is =+ -0.08 d18O and =+ -0.05 d13C. The Maiana record is continuous except for a gap from 1901-1905, which we bridged through straight forward comparison and splicing of data from a coral record from nearby Tarawa Atoll. Age model: Seasonally varying d13C values and ephemeral annual density bands provide the basis for annual age assignment. Ages were adjusted subseasonally by comparison to major El Nino and La Nina anomalies in a regional rainfall index (available at http:  tao.atmos.washington.edu datasets eqpacislandrainindex ); this procedure allows us to align major peaks and troughs that occur within the same calendar year with adjustments that are generally less than 3 months. Because corals grow at variable rates throughout the year, these small chronological adjustments are reasonable and customary (and do not affect estimates of multi-year variability). Near the base of the core, an age adjustment of 1 year was needed, suggesting an age uncertainty on the full record of 1 year. The Maiana coral grew at a rate of 7-12 mm per year; we interpolated records to a common time step of bimonthly resolution for further analysis. Replication: The record from core MAI95-2-3 is well replicated by additional records of 65-70 years from Maiana and Aranuka, ~75 km southeast of Maiana, (JEC, FEU, and JTO, manuscript in preparation) and by a published 97-year record from Tarawa Atoll, ~30 km north of Maiana. Correlation coefficients among coral and instrumental data over the common period 1950-89 are consistently high (Maiana_correlations.txt), adding confidence to single-core reconstruction of regional variability in western Kiribati. We focus on the MAI95-2-3 record for further analysis because it extends the record of ENSO into pre-instrumental periods and avoids nonstationarity that may be introduced through inclusion of records that differ in length. The 4-coral average correlates slightly better with instrumental data than most individual coral records, but only Mai 2-3 extends the instrumental record of ENSO. Linear correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong agreement between the Maiana record and ENSO variability (Table 1), and decadal averages of the Maiana record correlate significantly over the past century (>95% confidence) with those from the Tarawa coral record and regional rainfall indices, substantiating the reality of these more subtle low-frequency signals (JEC, FEU, and JTO, manuscript in preparation). On-line data are available free of charge, other forms are available for the cost of reproduction.

TITLE: Breeding Biology and Design of Population Monitoring Methods for Lapland Longspurs. ABSTRACT: Purpose: Data on variation in nesting density and clutch size will be used to understand how productivity varies among habitats and among years, especially in relation to the timing of spring. Data on reproductive success in various habitats prior to oil development will also serve as a baseline against which post-development estimates can be compared. Abstract: The Colville River Delta in northern Alaska supports large populations of breeding waterfowl, shorebirds, and loons. The Colville field station is one of the only programs devoted to monitoring long-term trends in tundra-breeding birds. Nesting density and reproductive success of all species occurring in fixed plots is monitored at this station. Species of current management interest include white-fronted geese, spectacled eiders, oldsquaw, and tundra swans. Shorebirds and loons are monitored as part of other USGS-Biological Resources Division studies..

TITLE: National Status and Trends Program Mussel Watch and Benthic Surveillance Programs Contaminants and Biological Response; NODC Archive Data. ABSTRACT: The National Status and Trends Program (NS&T) was initiated by NOAA to assess the contamination of estuarine and coastal waters of the United States by analyzing bivalves, fish livers and sediments through the Mussel Watch and Benthic Surveillance Programs. The goal of this program is to assess the distribution of contaminants, the biological response to contamination, and the temporal changes in the contaminants. Samples were collected and analyzed by NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Battelle Ocean Sciences, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and by the Texas A&M Research Foundation (Geochemical and Environmental Research Group). The contaminants analyzed were polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), total DDT's and total chlorinated pesticides (non-DDT) and the following metals: Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Tl, Zn. The first NS&T data available from NODC are the Mussel Watch Data analyzed by Battelle Ocean Sciences. Mussels were collected along the West Coast and in the East Coast (north of Delaware Bay); and oysters were collected from selected sites along the Gulf Coast, East Coast (south of Delaware Bay) and two sites in Hawaii. The sediment and bivalve data include locations, dates, depth, temperature, salinity, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total lipid content, trace metals, PCB's, PAH's and pesticides. In addition, the biovalve data contain species identification, mean shell length, gonadal index and organics; the sediment data include sediment grain size, wet weights, and dry weights. The Battelle data available from NODC are divided into three phases: Phase 1: 288 bivalve samples were collected at 96 locations from January 7, 1986 to May 13, 1986; 259 sediment samples were collected at 87 locations from January 15, 1986 to May 14, 1986. Phase 2: 297 bivalve samples were collected at 99 locations and 232 sediment samples were collected at 72 locations from November 11, 1986 to March 28, 1987. Phase 3: 321 bivalve samples were collected at 107 locations from November 20, 1987 to March 29, 1988..

TITLE: LANDSAT 4 5 Thematic Mapper System Corrected Pre-Flight Radiometric Correction and Nearest neighbour resampling product. ABSTRACT: Landsat TM data are available from December 1982 to February 1983 (Landsat 4) and from April 1984 onwards (Landsat 5). Most of the ESA archive has been acquired and processed at receiving stations in Fucino (Italy), Kiruna (Sweden) and Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain). However, the archive contains also a substantial number of data acquired and processed by receiving stations elsewhere (e.g. the US, Brasil, Canada, etc). As well as being available in Raw Format, Landsat data is corrected for distorsions in the imagery to a number of levels: one is the Corrected Pre-Flight Radiometric Correction and Nearest neighbour resampling product. A Landsat 4 and 5 TM scene has an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1 through 5 and band 7, band 6 has an IFOV of 120 square meters on the ground. The resolution for the TM sensor is shown below: ------------------ Resolution Landsats 4-5: (meters) Band 1: 30 Band 2: 30 Band 3: 30 Band 4: 30 Band 5: 30 Band 6: 120 Band 7: 30 ------------------ Landsat TM SCPRNN data is available in a digital format for: - Full scene: Full scene cover approximately 183 x 172.8 km. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection between a path and row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 20 km). For a floating full scene the placement along the path is chosen by the customer. The centre point of the floating full scene is defined by the path number and the required latitude. A full image is composed of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each band requires 40 Mbytes of storage space. - Quarter scene: ESA TM data (digital or photographic) is available in quadrants, each measuring 91.5 x 86 km. This option is available for raw data, system corrected or geocoded products. Numbering of standard quarter scenes is as follows: for floating quarter scenes the placement along-path and across-path is chosen by the customer. The centre of the floating quarter scene is defined by latitude and longitude. - Mini scenes: ESA TM data is available as images covering an area 47.2 x 44 km (a 16th of a full scene). This option is available for raw data, system corrected or geocoded products. The scenes are floating and the placement along-path and across-path is chosen by the customer. The centre of the scene is defined by latitude and longitude. To order data please see "http:  earth.esa.int helpandmail help_order.html".

TITLE: Biological Investigations of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS) Programme. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The Biological Investigations of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS) Programme was established in the late 1970's for the study of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and its living resources (Thorley, online resource). Data were collected during 3 major field experiments between 1981 and 1985, divided into two periods: First International BIOMASS Experiment (FIBEX) in 1980-1981, and the Second International BIOMASS Experiment (SIBEX) in 1983-1985. In total 34 cruises were carried out (El-Sayed, online resource), of which 21 cruises were gathered in this data set. This data set provides sea-bird observation collected in the cruises. PURPOSE: The main objective of BIOMASS was to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamic functioning of the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a basis for the future management of potential living resources (El-Sayed, online resource), with the particular focus on krill. Specifically, FIBEX was aimed at carrying out a quasi-synoptic survey over a wide area the South Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean. SIBEX was designed to produce a temporal sequence of observations focused on much smaller areas of the Bransfield Strait and Prydz Bay regions (Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure, online resource). Sea-birds data were collected as supporting data to krill. For further detail, you are referred to El-Sayed (1994).

TITLE: British Columbia Marbled Murrelet Occupied Detection Surveys: Digital dataset. ABSTRACT: This data set contains the most complete known Marbled Murrelet occupancy detections at inland stations at georeferenced locations throughout British Columbia. Detection information includes total number of detections, total number of audio, visual, audio and visual, and total occupied detections. When more than one survey took place at a particular station, the survey information is summed for a total detection. Summation can occur within years, or across years. The number of surveys conducted, and the years the surveys took place will be noted when available. This database is a compilation of many sources and occupied detection is in some cases defined by the original scientists. Otherwise protocol is set by the Pacific Seabird Group (2000) as 1) Birds flying below canopy, through, into, or out of forest canopy, 2) Birds perching, landing, or attempting to land, or 3) Birds calling from a stationary position. A call is stationary when more than 3 calls are heard..

TITLE: Fungi isolates from physical samples (soil, rock, wood, foodstuff, air, artifacts, etc) from heroic era sites in the Ross Sea Region to determine fungal biodiversity. ABSTRACT: Physical samples of soil, rocks, wood, foodstuffs, air and artefacts were collected from six Heroic era sites in the Ross Sea Region over the period of January 1999 to January 2008. These sites included the three historic huts at Hut Point, Cape Evans and Cape Royds on Ross Island (from 1998-2008), the historic hut at Cape Adare (2002-2003), the rock hut at Cape Crozier (2000-2001) and the Granite house at Cape Geology, Granite Harbour (2002-2003). Fungi were isolated from these samples using a variety of techniques (including spore traps), media and temperatures. The results from these studies were used to determine fungal biodiversity, the effect of the introduction of a nutrient source in a pristine environment on native fungal species, the impact of humans, and introduction of foreign fungi into a harsh environment. The fungi isolated from these locations have been studied to determine adaption survival strategies. All cultures are held in culture collections at The Universities of Waikato and Minnesota. Huts and artefacts were digitally videotaped to compare the rate of deterioration from year to year. January 1990 samples: Hut Point >100 samples, Cape Evans >200 samples, Cape Royds >200 samples; December 1999 samples Hut Point >50 samples, Cape Evans >130 samples, Cape Royds >90 samples.

TITLE: Greenland Summit Ice Cores. ABSTRACT: From 1989 to 1994, the U.S. and European scientific communities supported a bold undertaking to acquire an extensive paleoclimate record for the Northern Hemisphere. These efforts, termed the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) and Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2), acquired deep ice cores from sites on and near the Greenland summit. The GISP2 (US) site was located at 72 degrees 36 minutes N, 38 degrees 30 minutes W. The GRIP (European) site was located at 72 degrees 35 minutes N, 37 degrees 38 minutes W. A wide range of environmental and physical parameters were recorded from the cores. The data types are listed below: - Air Mass Trajectories (GISP2) - Chemistry (GISP2, GRIP) - Climatological Data (GISP2) - Cosmogenic Isotopes (GISP2) - Dust (GISP2) - Electrical Conductivity (GISP2, GRIP) - Gas Concentrations in Air Bubbles (GISP2, GRIP) - Physical Properties and Ice Core Stratigraphy (GISP2, GRIP) - Stable Isotopes (GISP2, GRIP) - Time scales (GISP2, GRIP) The GRIP and GISP2 data presented on this CD-ROM were acquired as a part of a multi-institutional effort involving the GISP2 Science Management Office (SMO) at the University of New Hampshire, the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data Coordination Center (ADCC) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the International Ice Core Data Cooperative (IICDC) at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), and the World Data Center (WDC) for Paleoclimatology, Boulder at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Documentation, CD-ROM format and structure, artwork, and data format were carried out jointly by NSIDC and the WDC for Paleoclimatology. All GISP2 and GRIP data are jointly archived at the ADCC at NSIDC and at the WDC for Paleoclimatology, NOAA-NCDC.

TITLE: European Diatom Database-Finnish Dataset. ABSTRACT: The European Diatom Database (EDDI) is a web-based information system designed to enhance the application of diatom analysis to problems of surface water acidification, eutrophication and climate change. The Finish Lapland training set comprises 151 samples from lakes in the pH range 5.0-8.3. A sub-set of 30 of these lakes has been published as a training set (Weckstr?m et al. 1997). These lakes are distributed across the treeline, spanning boreal forest to tundra along a steep climatic gradient. The extended training set was produced with the intention of creating a transfer function for temperature. Surface sediment samples (0-1cm) were collected using a gravity corer during summer 1994 and 1995. Samples for analysis of water chemistry were collected during July 1995.

TITLE: Polar Continental Shelf Project Weather Observation Database. ABSTRACT: This data set stems from a need to provide on-site weather reconnaissance to aircraft operating in support of arctic field research camps (spring and summer). These camps were operated by the Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP), a Canadian federal government organization that provides logistical support for arctic research. These data were digitized and stored in an ad hoc fashion over the years. An effort was made to record and store the recorded data, resulting in the database presented here. The database consists of approximately 53,000 observations, taken twice daily, from 600 unique sites throughout the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Individual time series can include various climatic parameters and vary in length from a few observations taken on one day to hundreds of observations made over a period of four months. Prevalent climatic elements include dry-bulb temperature, wind direction and speed, and total cloud cover. 95% of all time series include screen-height dry-bulb temperature. To rescue and make available valuable polar climate data.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Binned 4 KM Seasonal Climatology Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  Each Aqua MODIS Level-3 binned (4 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a season, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells have a resolution of 4.6x4.6km. Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. Aqua MODIS SST binned products consist of: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT The MODIS Aqua Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Binned .

TITLE: Historic CH4 Records from Antarctic and Greenland Ice Cores, Antarctic Firn Data, and Archived Air Samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania in CDIAC Trends Online. ABSTRACT: This data represents one thousand years of atmospheric methane concentrations. Methane concentrations was measured in air bubbles from 1008-1980 in Antarctic ice cores, and from 1075-1885 in Greenland ice cores. Air in firn samples from 1978 to 1993 are also included as well as archived air samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania for the years 1978-1995. For more information on methodology and access to data, see: http:  cdiac.ornl.gov trends atm_meth lawdome_meth.html and ftp:  ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov pub data paleo icecore antarctica law law_ch4.txt Data from WDC Paleoclimatology consists of ice core methane concentration measurements from the Law Dome DE08, DE08-2, and DSS ice cores, plus Greenland Summit (EUROCORE) ice core, are listed. These data are combined with measurements of firn air from DE08-2 and archived air samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania, to calculate global annual mean methane concentrations from 1010 AD to 1992 AD, also listed. The methane ice core records presented here are derived from three cores obtained from Law Dome, East Antarctica from 1987 to 1993, and samples from the Eurocore and GISP2 ice cores from the Summit region, Greenland. The Law Dome sites satisfy many of the desirable characteristics of an ideal ice core site for atmospheric reconstructions including negligible melting of the ice sheet surface, low concentrations of impurities, regular stratigraphic layering undisturbed at the surface by wind or at depth by ice flow, and high snow accumulation rate. Further details on the Law Dome sites, drilling, cores, ice dating and air dating are provided in Etheridge et al. (1996), Etheridge and Wookey (1989), Morgan et al. (1997), Levchenko et al. (1996) and Trudinger et al. (1997). The air enclosed in the three ice cores from Law Dome, Antarctica has unparalleled age resolution and extends into recent decades, because of the high rate of snow accumulation at the Law Dome drill sites (Etheridge et al. 1996). These data supersede those published earlier from the Law Dome ice core DE08 (Etheridge et al., Tellus, 1992) offering greater precision, elimination of a small and variable contamination, and more accurate dating. The methane concentrations were measured by gas chromatography and are given in the CSIRO94 CH4 scale, which is indistinguishable from the NOAA CMDL scale. Precision of each ice core methane measurement is about 5 ppb (1 sigma). The firn air samples were pumped from the firn layer at the DE08-2 drill site. Their effective ages range from 1993 AD for the surface to 1978 AD at a depth of 85 m. The firn air was dated by firn diffusion modelling (Trudinger et al., JGR, 1997). The archived air samples were collected several times per year during "baseline" wind conditions at the Cape Grim station since 1978 AD (Langenfelds et al., 1996)..

TITLE: BIGFOOT GPP SURFACES FOR NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN SITES, 2000-2004. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BigFoot project gathered Gross Primary Production (GPP) data for nine EOS Land Validation Sites located from Alaska to Brazil from 2000 to 2004. Each site is representative of one or two distinct biomes, including the Arctic tundra; boreal evergreen needleleaf forest; temperate cropland, grassland, evergreen needleleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest; desert grassland and shrubland; and tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. At this time we are archiving Northern Old Black Spruce (NOBS - BOREAS NSA, Canada) and Harvard Forest LTER (HARV - Massachusetts, USA) data collected in 2001.The GPP surfaces were produced by a spatial version of an ecosystem process model named, Biome-BGC. Inputs to the model included Landsat ETM+ derived Land Cover and LAI, tower derived meteorological variables, and a set of site level ecophysical parameters. The model was calibrated using field measured NPP and validated by tower derived estimates of GPP. For an in depth discussion of methods used to produce these surfaces, please see Turner et al. (2003).Each BigFoot GPP product covers a 7 x 7 km extent and consists of the GPP surface in BIP format (280 rows by 280 columns by 365 bands at 25 meter resolution) and an accompanying text file which provides metadata specific to the image (such as projection, data type, etc). Additional information on GPP surface development can be found on the BigFoot website at http:  www.fsl.orst.edu larse bigfoot ovr_mthd.html Project Background: Reflectance data from MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra (http:  landval.gsfc.nasa.gov MODIS index.php), is used to produce several science products including land cover, leaf area index (LAI), gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). The overall goal of the BigFoot Project was to provide validation of these products. To do this, BigFoot combined ground measurements, additional high resolution remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at nine flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products. BigFoot characterized up to a 7 x 7 km area (49 MODIS pixels) surrounding the CO2 flux towers located at each of the nine sites. We collected multi-year, in situ measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allowed us to examine scales and spatial pattern of these properties, the inter-annual variability and validity of MODIS products, and provided for a field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint. BigFoot was funded by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program.For more details on the BigFoot Project, please visit the website: http:  www.fsl.orst.edu larse bigfoot index.html..

TITLE: Lack of Reproduction in Muskoxen and Arctic Hares Caused by Early Winter. ABSTRACT: A lack of young muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and arctic hares (Lepus arcticus) in the Eureka area of Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), Canada, was observed during summer 1998, in contrast to most other years since 1986. Evidence of malnourished muskoxen was also found. Early winter weather and a consequent 50% reduction of the 1997 summer replenishment period appeared to be the most likely cause, giving rise to a new hypothesis about conditions that might cause adverse demographic effects in arctic herbivores. The study area included a 150 km2 region of the Fosheim Peninsula in a 180o arc north of Eureka, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada (all within about 9 km of 80oN, 86oW). The area, extending from Eureka Sound to Remus Creek and from Slidre Fiord to Eastwind Lake, included shoreline, hills, lowlands, creek bottoms, and the west side of Blacktop Ridge. An associate, Layne Adams, and I spent 1-11 July 1998 in this area on all-terrain vehicles, following a pair of wolves Canis lupus (Mech, 1994). Adams and I also surveyed the surrounding area with binoculars for prey animals, in much the same manner that my assistants and I have practiced for one to six weeks each summer in the same area since 1986 (Mech, 1995, 1997). Because both muskoxen and arctic hares were common residents of the area during most years and were not the focus of our studies, no standardized counts were made. However, general field notes were sufficient to document that during most summers both species and their young were present..

TITLE: Permafrost Map of Canada. ABSTRACT: This map depicts the distribution, characteristics, and boundaries of permafrost and ground ice in Canada. Permafrost classification is based on the proportion of land that is underlain by permafrost within a a given area. Canada was divided into physiographic units, and each unit was classified in terms of permafrost extent and ground ice content. The map shows mountain permafrost as sporadic or isolated discontinuous permafrost, rather than as a separate category. This map can be found in the The National Atlas of Canada, 5th Edition (1978-95) published by Natural Resources Canada. The map and descriptive information was taken from the National Atlas of Canada website http:  atlas.gc.ca. 2002.

TITLE: Model Output Assessing Net Carbon Exchange Across the Arctic Tundra-Boreal Forest Transition in Alaska, 1981-2000. ABSTRACT: In this study, investigators simulated the temporal and spatial patterns of net carbon exchange in Alaskan ecosystems that span the transition from Arctic tundra to boreal forest. They modeled net carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems by the balance between net primary production (NPP) and decomposition. They also modeled vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen pools in tundra, shrub tundra, and tree line evergreen conifer forest ecosystems. Field data were used to develop parameterizations for the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) 5.0. Investigators extrapolated the model spatially over the Alaskan Arctic to boreal tree line to simulate changes in vegetation and soil carbon storage from 1981-2000 (Thompson et al. 2005).

TITLE: North Pole Environmental Observatory Aerial CTD Survey. ABSTRACT: This data set includes conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), pressure, salinity, potential temperature, and density data, which were collected yearly, 2000 to 2006, in the Arctic Ocean as part of the North Pole Environmental Observatory. Investigators landed a helicopter or skiplane on the arctic sea ice and took measurements using a Seabird SBE-19 Seacat with a portable winch.They processed the data using the SEASOFT recipe to minimize salinity spiking and correct for a thermal lag of the conductivity cell. Certain constants were determined by empirical trial, which differed slightly for each year. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, d\ eploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year. More information about the project is available at the project Web site, North Pole Environmental Observatory (http:  psc.apl.washington.edu northpole ).

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Yearly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships. For more detailed information, see the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for MODIS Detached Coccolith Concentration http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod23.pdf The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Calcite (CLCT) data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA L3SMI .

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Cumulative Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: BIGFOOT LEAF AREA INDEX SURFACES FOR NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN SITES, 2000-2003. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BigFoot project gathered leaf area index (LAI) data for nine EOS Land Validation Sites located from Alaska to Brazil from 2000 to 2003. Each site is representative of one or two distinct biomes, including the Arctic tundra; boreal evergreen needleleaf forest; temperate cropland, grassland, evergreen needleleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest; desert grassland and shrubland; and tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. LAI was measured at plots within each site for at least two years using standard direct and optical methods at each site. Direct measurement approaches included periodic area harvest for non-forest sites and application of allometric equations to tree diameter data for forest sites. LAI was also estimated indirectly using the Li-Cor LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzers (Gower et al. 1999). LAI was measured three times each year at the forest sites and four to six times at other sites depending upon the phenology of LAI development for a given ecosystem. To develop LAI surfaces at any given site, the Landsat ETM+ image closest in date to maximum LAI was chosen as a reference and images from other dates radiometrically normalized to it. Each LAI surface has a grain of 25 meters and covers a 7 x 7 km extent. The data set consists of the LAI surface images in standard geotiff format, an accompanying text file which provides metadata specific to the image (such as projection, data type, class names, etc), and associated auxiliary and world files. Additional information on LAI measurements and surface development can be found on the BigFoot website at http:  www.fsl.orst.edu larse bigfoot ovr_mthd.html. BigFoot Project Background: Reflectance data from MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra (http:  landval.gsfc.nasa.gov MODIS index.php), is used to produce several science products including land cover, leaf area index (LAI) and net primary p roduction (NPP). The overall goal of the BigFoot Project was to provi de validation of these products. To do this, BigFoot combined ground measurements, additional high resolution remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at nine flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products. BigFoot characterized up to a 7 x 7 km area (49 MODIS pixels) surrounding the CO2 flux towers located at each of the nine sites. We collected multi-year, in situ measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allowed us to examine scales and spatial pattern of these properties, the inter-annual variability and validity of MODIS products, and provided for a field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint. BigFoot was funded by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Monthly Climatology Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: Landscape Map of the Russian Arctic Coastal Zone. ABSTRACT: The map consists of ESRI Shapefiles of landscape polygons (in landscape unit types) for the Russian Arctic coastal zone (scale 1:4,000,000). The map is based on a digital circumpolar Lambert projection map. Polygons have a single attribute (LAND-ID). LAND-ID is an eight-character code that describes the landscape unit. The first two digits code zone, the third and fourth code landscape, the fifth through seventh code lithology, and the eighth codes substrate chemistry. The code is described in detail in an accompanying legend. Large polygons enclosing islands, or continental land areas between major rivers, form the boundaries of many smaller landscape polygons. These large enclosing polygons have LAND-ID values of 0. Some smaller islands (e.g., Zemlya Frantsa) have no codes associated with them. Areas on the far eastern portion of the map also have no code..

TITLE: Analysis of Glacier Hazard Potentials By Knowledge-Based Remote Sensing Fusion for GIS Modeling (AGREG). ABSTRACT: Snow, glaciers and permafrost in cold mountain areas such as the Swiss Alps are especially sensitive to changes in environmental conditions due to their proximity to melting conditions. In addition, mass wasting is most intensive in those mountain areas with high relief energy. Environmental changes in high mountain regions substantially influence the potential for glacial and periglacial hazards. Ice- and moraine-dammed lakes represent a widespread hazard potential closely related to glacier fluctuations. Magnitude and frequency of ice avalanches from steep glaciers - in principle a normal expression of mass exchange under such topographic conditions - are coupled with stability conditions affected by glacier advance retreat and, hence, with long-term atmospheric impacts. Steep and unstable reservoirs of loose debris, a potential source of debris flows, are often the result of glacier shrinkage. In a similar way, changes in the stress regime due to vanishing glaciers lead to potential destabilization of adjacent valley flanks. Since the Alps are among the most densely populated high mountain areas in the world, Switzerland is particularly impacted by glacial and periglacial hazards but, on the other hand, also has an extensive and well-recognized tradition in investigating such processes. A number of specific monitoring and modeling studies related to single hazardous situations have been performed, mainly based on recent catastrophes or imminent hazard situations. An urgent need exists for area-wide modeling of glacier hazard potentials with a view to establishing an integrated and adequate information base for planning and detailed monitoring, but a corresponding systematic approach is, for the present, still lacking. The proposed project aims at closing this gap in several ways: Work Package (WP) (1): By developing techniques for detection of glacier hazard potentials based on optical spaceborne remote sensing data which rarely has been used to date in Swiss glacier monitoring; multispectral analyses and multitemporal and multiscale fusion will play a major role in this, with a special focus on recent or upcoming high resolution sensors. WP (2): By integrating empirical models for glacier hazard assessment into geographical information systems (GIS) which have proven to be successful for hazard simulation but have not been used yet for determining glacier hazard potentials; GIS modeling especially allows for the fusion of remote sensing and elevation data for spatial (3D) analyses. To ensure high synergy, WPs (1) and (2) will be closely related to the ongoing SNF project "The Swiss Glacier Inventory 2000" (SWI 2000) (no. 21-54073.98) and the international project "Global Land Ice Monitoring from Space" (GLIMS). WP (3): By applying the methods from WPs (1) and (2), an initial attempt will be undertaken to implement an area-wide model for integrating glacier hazard potentials of extensive regions in the Swiss Alps following a downscaling strategy with varying resolution and accuracy levels, both with respect to data and to models. As hazard management in Switzerland is the domain of local and regional authorities, the proposed project does not aim at preparing detailed local hazard maps (Gefahrenkarten), but rather will provide new remote sensing and modeling techniques for decision support. It should demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques for overview mapping (Gefahrenhinweiskarten) as a basis for decision-making and for scenario simulations in connection with climate change effects. The efforts made in this project will contribute to handle economically complex mathematical and physical models and represent a decision basis for the specific need of further detailed case studies. A further outcome will be a documentation of historical glacier catastrophes in the Swiss Alps, which will - among others - be used for model calibration and verification.

TITLE: Meteorology and Soil Temperatures, Hot Weather Creek, Ellesmere Island, NWT, Canada. ABSTRACT: The instrumentation was installed in June 1988 and was initially maintained by the Arctic Adaptation Division Canadian Climate Centre, Atmospheric Environment Service (CCC AES) with field support by Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). It consists of a Campbell Scientific CR10 micrologger with meteorological sensors for air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar incoming radiation. It also supports a snow depth sensor, an experimental vegetation temperature and four ground temperatures. It is powered by a 25-AH, 12-volt gel cell (a second gel cell was added in 1989) charged by a 10-watt solar panel. Hourly and Daily sampling was carried out. Data have been quality controlled and fully documented (see documentation files accompanying the data). The High Arctic Integrated Research and Monitoring Area (IRMA) of the GSC was established on Fosheim Peninsula to support interdisciplinary studies related to environmental change. Research carried out between 1989 and 1994, had as primary objective to determine relationships between geomorphic processes and climate in order to help predict the potential geologic impact of global change. Establishment of detailed paleoclimatic records for this region has also been considered essential to provide a context for ongoing climate change. Paleoecological studies (records of peat cores, lakes cores, ice cores, sea cores and archeological records) in concert with other methodologies have been used to outline climatic variability (short, middle or long-term variabilities) and are a primary research component in the region. A major compilation of 20 papers has been produced (see Garneau in press) involving 34 participants from government, universities and industry. The synthesis includes the results from studies of modern conditions (climate, flora and fauna), quaternary geology and glacial history, paleoenvironmental records (i.e. ice cores, ocean, lakes, peat, archeological sites), permafrost dynamics and hydrologic systems. Nine appendices complete the document including a comprehensive bibliography and various data series (climate, vegetation, insects, geophysics, plant and arthropod macrofossils and radiocarbon dates) to provide background forfuture projects in the area. These data are on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, and were identified for inclusion through the efforts of Kathy Young, Ph.D. graduate of Department of Geography, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario..

TITLE: Kittlitz's Murrelet Known Nest Locations (GIS layer). ABSTRACT: The Kittlitz's Murrelet Brachyramphus brevirostris is bird is a species of environmental concern, and only 21 confirmed nest locations are published for North America. A wider analysis of these nest sites is coming forward, and it appears that these nests are associated with glaciers and vulcanoe slopes. However, this is only an impression based on the small sample of nests. This species also occurs in Russia, but only few details are known. The species is reported to underlie drastic declines during the last 20 years, likely due to global change, e.g. glacier retreat. The data presented here are derived from a species account (Day et al. 1999) and geo-referenced in Arc View GIS. They can be used for further analyzing and modeling in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Caution is to be taken when interpreting these nest locations because the sample size is extremely low, and nests were found in a somewhat opportunistic fashion. For use and interpretation of this data set, please contact experts..

TITLE: Canadian GPS Validation Networks (GPS Basenets). ABSTRACT: The need for a "truth" against which to test Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy and precision has led to the establishment of 15 GPS validation network sites across Canada, also known as GPS basenets. Geodetic Survey Division (GSD) provides precise standard measurements for all GPS validation networks (GPS basenet) across Canada. An agency in each of the provinces is responsible for the construction, maintenance and access policies for GPS validation network sites within their geographic area.The GPS validation networks across Canada serve as a physical standard for evaluating GPS equipment, software and positioning methodologies.

TITLE: Biological Atlas of the Arctic Seas 2000-Plankton of the Barents and Kara Seas. ABSTRACT: Presented are (a) physical and biological data collected during 158 scientific cruises carried out in the period 1913-1999 and (b) data on phytoplankton collected in 1994-1999 during cruises of nuclear icebreakers in the region extending from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea. Listed are phytoplankton and zooplankton species of the Arctic Seas. Ecological and geographic characteristics are given to each individual species. Pictures of live cells illustrate the dominant species. Based on the pattern of the annual cycle of the plankton variability, proposed criteria are presented for the quality control of phytoplankton and zooplankton data. The methods of objective analysis are used for mapping the distribution of physical and biological characteristics of the Barents and Kara Seas. Changes in the plankton community structure between the 1930's, 1950's, and 1990's are discussed. It is demonstrated that observed differences substantially exceed the error resulting from the use of various methods for plankton sampling. The goal of this work was to implement the information of the plankton communities of the Arctic Seas into the study of the ocean climatic system. To reach this goal we needed to solve the following problems: a) develop an electronic plankton database for the Barents and Kara Seas; b) document the variation in the plankton communities over periods of time. Several generations of Russian investigators, observers, and mariners collected hydrobiologic data in the Arctic Seas during the period 1910-1950. These data represent a basic tool for the study of the Arctic Seas. Many scientists involved in this research added to their knowledge, expertise and skill in making marine surveys thanks to the historic investigations of A. Linko, K. Deryugin, B. Manteifel, M. Kamshilov, E. Zelikman, and scientists of other generations. The Atlas was written in Russian and translated into English. The authors have attempted to retain the original character of the text as it was translated into English. It is published in both Russian and English. The cited website is also accessible in both Russian and English. Information to create this metadata was taken from http:  www.nodc.noaa.gov OC5 BARPLANK WWW HTML database.html.

TITLE: 1:100,000-scale and 1:250,000-scale Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Data from the U.S. Geological Survey. ABSTRACT: The set of Land Use and Land cover and associated maps consists of Land Cover, political units, hydrologic units, census county subdivisions, Federal land ownership, and State land ownership. The Land Use and Land Cover map is compiled to portray the Level II categories of the Land Use and Land Cover classification system documented by Anderson and others (1976). The Level II categories of this Land Use and Land Cover classification system provide the user with a basic framework to which third-and fourth-level categories may be added. The associated maps portray either natural or administrative information. They provide the user with the opportunity to utilize the Land Use and Land Cover maps and data, either individually or collectively, to produce graphic or tabular data for the areas portrayed on the associated maps. This mapping system is constructed in such a way that the Land Use and Land Cover data can be related to other resource fields such as soils, geology, hydrology, and demography.

TITLE: Snow Pit Data from Greenland Summit, 1989 to 1993. ABSTRACT: Chemistry and isotope information from snow pits dug at the Summit area of Greenland, 1989-1993 includes major ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, NO3, SO4), oxygen isotopes (18O) and H2O2. Four snow pits were dug and sampled in 1989, three snow pits in 1990, two in 1991, one in 1992 and one in 1993. All snow pits had a 3 cm sampling interval except the snow pits in 1990, which had either a 3 cm or 5 cm sampling interval. Chemistry and isotope information were obtained from each of the snow pits. The pits and surface snow samples were collected by the Glacier Research Group (GRG), using established protocols to prevent contamination. The samples collected in 1991 were analyzed at the GISP2 drilling camp. All data except the oxygen isotope data, which is from the University of Washington, were generated by GRG at the University of New Hampshire..

TITLE: National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Network in Canada. ABSTRACT: The National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Network was established in 1969 as a joint program of the federal and provincial governments to monitor and assess the quality of the ambient air in Canadian urban centres. Air quality data for sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and total suspended particulates (TSP) are measured at over 152 stations in 55 cities in the ten provinces and two territories. Various statistics derived from the measurements and comparisons with the National Air Quality Objectives prescribed under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act are published in annual data reports. In addition to the criteria pollutants, the Division, with the assistance from provincial and municipal NAPS network cooperating agencies, carries out a number of other monitoring activities to support priority national air issues. For Canada's national Smog (Ground-Level Ozone) Management Program, data for nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are being collected. The NAPS database has been expanded to include ozone observations from Canadian and U.S. rural monitoring locations in order to allow analysis of regional ozone episodes. Measurements of PM10 (suspended particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 micro meters) and PM2.5 have been made at Canadian sites since 1984. Sample filters are analyzed for 50 elements (including toxic metals such as arsenic, lead and mercury) 14 inorganic and organic anions and 11 inorganic cations. Since 1988, the Centre has been developing and applying improved techniques for measuring potentially toxic air contaminants. Measurements of VOC (aromatics, aldehydes and ketones) and semi-volatile organic compounds (PAHs, dioxins and furans) are now carried out at 40 urban and rural locations in Canada. The data have formed the principal ambient air exposure data base for 14 Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) Priority Substances List (PSL) assessments. A number of reports which provide results from the toxic air monitoring programs are available upon request.Air quality data gathered by the NAPS Network provide the basis for evaluating air pollution control strategies, identifying urban air quality trends and for warning of emerging air pollution issues. The recognition in recent years of the importance of long range transport of air pollution (both national and international) underlines the usefulness of a nationwide network of air monitoring stations.

TITLE: Thick and thin sections and salinity and temperature profiles from natural refrozen and artificially refrozen sea ice cracks. ABSTRACT: Large marine organisms, specifically foraminifers and copepods, were collected from the sea ice, brine and water column from thin ice north of Beaufort Island at the beginning of the warming period when the brine channels in the sea ice are widening, providing a conduit for organisms at the bottom of the ice to migrate to the top. A suit of ice cores were collected from 9 stations in sea ice varying in thickness. Eight stations were on ice that formed last winter and one station was on second year ice in which the brine channels from the previous year were closed but clearly visible. At each station, a complete core (cut into approximately 25cm sections), a brine sample and an under-ice plankton tow was collected. Corresponding cores from each site were collected for iron and iron isotopes, gases, dimethyl sulfide, temperature (measured on the spot) and salinity, and biology (algae and bacteria). Additional samples of bottom sea ice were obtained from blocks cut in the ice near Cape Evans and off Cape Barne where there was a thick carpet of diatoms and associated biota at the bottom of the ice. Further samples were obtained of the under-ice community and the sediments below the ice near Cape Evans including a time series of under ice samples collected about a week apart from each other..

TITLE: BIGFOOT LAND COVER SURFACES FOR NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN SITES, 2000-2003. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The BigFoot project gathered data for nine EOS Land Validation Sites located from Alaska to Brazil from 2000 to 2003. Each site is representative of one or two distinct biomes, including the Arctic tundra; boreal evergreen needleleaf forest; temperate cropland, grassland, evergreen needleleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest; desert grassland and shrubland; and tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. These surfaces were produced from Landsat ETM+ imagery to explicitly characterize the land cover at the BigFoot Sites to provide validation of the MODIS land cover product. The land cover scheme is consistent with the categories defined by the MOD12 IGBP (http:  geography.bu.edu landcover userguidelc index.html) strategy. Each BigFoot land cover product covers approximately a 7 x 7 km extent and consists of the land cover surface image in standard geotiff format, an accompanying text file which provides metadata specific to the image (such as projection, data type, class names, etc), and associated auxiliary and world files. BigFoot Project Background:Reflectance data from MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra (http:  landval.gsfc.nasa.gov MODIS index.php), is used to produce several science products including land cover, leaf area index (LAI) and net primary production (NPP). The overall goal of the BigFoot Project was to provide validation of these products. To do this, BigFoot combined ground measurements, additional high resolution remote sensing data, and ecosystem process models at nine flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products. BigFoot characterized up to a 7 x 7 km area (49 MODIS pixels) surrounding the CO2 flux towers located at each of the nine sites. We collected multi-year, in situ measurements of ecosystem structure and functional characteristics related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our sampling design allowed us to examine scales and spatial pattern of these properties, the inter-annual variability and validity of MODIS products, and provided for a field-based ecological characterization of the flux tower footprint. BigFoot was funded by NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program..

TITLE: Sedimentary Denitrification Rates from the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. ABSTRACT: This data set contains the sedimentary denitrification rates from the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas obtained during August-September 1992, and rates obtained in the Beaufort Sea off Pt. Barrow, Alaska, under late wintertime conditions (March 1993). The estimates made during August-September were based on both deployments of an automated in-situ benthic flux chamber tripod and on pore water chemical profiles from cores analyzed aboard the R V Alpha Helix.

TITLE: Impacts of climate change on Antarctic vascular plants: warming and UV-B radiation. ABSTRACT: Our research examined the influence of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) and warming on the performance of Antarctic flowering plants (i.e. Deschampsia antarctica, Antarctic hairgrass and Colobanthus quitensis, Antarctic pearlwort). Our research endeavors fell into the following categories: 1) We conducted a long-term field experiment at Stepping Stones, near Palmer Station, in which we reduced levels of UV radiation and raised air temperatures around naturally growing Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis plants for four consecutive growing seasons. We examined plant responses to these manipulations by assessing photosynthesis, vegetative growth, cover, and sexual reproduction. At the end of this experiment, we collected plant, soil and litter samples, and examined treatment effects on plant biomass production, litter accumulation, soil properties, and microarthropod populations. 2) Single growing-season experiments were also conducted at Stepping Stones, primarily aimed at examining the influence of UV-B radiation on plant growth processes and concentrations of UV-screening compounds in leaves, and soil seed banks. 3) We also conducted a more intensive short-term experiment at Palmer Station, in which we placed potted plants under UV-B transparent or UV-B absorbing filters from November through late December, corresponding to the ozone depletion enhanced UV-B season. We assessed the influence of ambient UV-B during the ozone depletion period by examining UV-screening compound concentrations, and rates of photosynthesis, plant growth and DNA damage. 4) To quantify the short-term UV-B responses of these species under more controlled conditions, we examined the UV dose response of DNA damage and screening compound concentrations in these species in growth chamber studies at our home institution. 5) We examined the temperature response of antarctic plants, by characterizing the photosynthetic and respiratory responses of naturally growing plants to temperature at Palmer Station. We also characterized their long-term, or acclimation, responses to rising temperatures, in terms of photosynthesis, respiration and growth, in a series of growth chamber experiments..

TITLE: ARCSS-LAII 1996 Aircraft Radiometric Data. ABSTRACT: During the summer of 1996, radiometric data over the Kuparuk River basin on the North Slope of Alaska were collected using the NOAA Long-EZ and Cessna 206 light aircraft. The area covered runs from north to south along the 148 degrees 55 minutes and 149 degrees 30 minutes lines of west longitude from approximately the Arctic Ocean (70.5 degrees N) to the foothills of the Alaskan Brooks Range (68.5 degrees N). Reflected spectral radiance was measured using an Exotech Model 100A Four Channel Radiometer, and recorded at 1 second intervals (1Hz) as digital counts (NOAA Long EZ) or analog voltages (Cessna 206). The digital counts were converted to voltages, and then all voltages were converted to radiance values. The data files are in tab-delimited format..

TITLE: Pacific Alkenone Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Marine sediments from the Chilean continental margin are used to infer millennial-scale changes in southeast Pacific surface ocean water properties and Patagonian ice sheet extent since the last glacial period. Our data show a clear "Antarctic" timing of sea surface temperature changes, which appear systematically linked to meridional displacements in sea ice, westerly winds, and the circumpolar current system. Proxy data for ice sheet changes show a similar pattern as oceanographic variations offshore, but reveal a variable glacier-response time of up to ~1000 years, which may explain some of the current discrepancies among terrestrial records in southern South America. This data set is the Alkenone-based Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction. Alkenone data is from ODP Site 1233..

TITLE: Neogene Ice Streams and Sedimentary Processes on High-Latitude Continental Margins. ABSTRACT: The evolution of continental margins from temperate to polar conditions is still poorly known. There are increasing evidences collected in the Arctic and Antarctic margins that the high sediment input from ice streams produces a phase of margin instability, including catastrophic collapses, before a long lasting equilibrium is reached. The Arctic margins can be regarded as younger, unstable counterparts of mature polar Antarctic margins that began to evolve in the Oligocene-Miocene. We propose an integrated geophysical and sedimentological approach to an Arctic ice stream dominated depositional system from inner shelf to deep sea in order to reconstruct its evolution since pre-glacial times (prior to the Late Pliocene). We chose the relatively small glacial depositional system on the Southern Svalbard margin because it is located in a highly climatically sensitive area of the Northern Hemisphere (narrow gateway to the Arctic ocean), with a small ice catchment and a fairly well known glacial history on land. We propose a 45 days-long cruise on the BIO Hesperides to undertake a full multibeam bathymetric survey of the glacial depositional system, which includes areas of known, but not well-studied slope instability phenomena. Shallow seismics (TOPAS) will provide acoustic facies characterization. Deeper penetration, intermediate resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles will provide the architectural evolution of the margin using ties to nearby ODP-DSDP holes. The project includes a plan for documentation and dissemination of results through TV and audiovisual products. El conocimiento sobre la evolución de los márgenes continentales de condiciones templadas polares es todavía escaso. Cada vez hay más evidencias, recogidas en los márgenes árticos y antárticos, de que el alto aporte sedimentario incluido por las corrientes de hielo (“ice streams”) produce una fase de inestabilidad del margen que comporta colapsos catastróficos. Esto sucede recursivamente hasta que se alcanza de nuevo un equilibrio duradero. Los márgenes árticos pueden ser calificados como jóvenes e inestables en comparación con los márgenes antárticos, más maduros, que desde el Oligoceno-Mioceno ya comencaron su evolución. Proponemos un estudio integrado, tanto geofísico como sedimentológico, de un sistema deposicional ártico, desde la plataforma interna hasta la llanura abisal, dominado por una corriente de hielo, con el objetivo de reconstruir su evolución desde tiempos pre-glaciales (con anterioridad al Plioceno superior). Se ha elegido un sistema deposicional glaciar relativamente pequeño en el margen meridional de las Islas Svalbard porque está situado en un área climáticamente muy sensible del hemisferio norte (con conexión restringida con el océano Ártico). Este sistema deposicional tiene un área de captación de hielo de tamaño pequeño y una historia glacial bien conocida en tierra. Proponemos una campaña oceanográfica de 45 días de duración a bordo del BIO Hespérides, o equivalente, para obtener cobertura total de batimetría de multihaz del sistema deposicional glaciar, que incluye áreas de conocida, aunque no bien estudiada, inestabilidad sedimentaria. La caracterización del recubrimiento sedimentario superficial se llevará a cabo mediante perfiles de sísmica de muy alta resolución (TOPAS). La evolución de la arquitectura del margen se estudiará mediante perfiles de sísmica de multicanal de resolución media y su correlación con sondeos ODP-DSDP cercanos. El proyecto incluye un plan para la documentación y diseminación de los resultados a través de TV y otros productos audiovisuales..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Daily Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships. For more detailed information, see the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for MODIS Detached Coccolith Concentration http:  modis.gsfc.nasa.gov data atbd atbd_mod23.pdf The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Calcite (CLCT) data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA L3SMI .

TITLE: Virulence of Selected Salmonid-Pathogenic Bacteria in Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus). ABSTRACT: Arctic char are a very important commercial and sport fisheries salmonid species, particularly in northern geographic ranges such as northern US, Canada and in Scandinavian countries. Recently, interest in intensive culture of Arctic Char has increased in more southern geographic areas and where water temperatures are warmer. Presently, two commercial growers are culturing Arctic char in West Virginia. The Freshwater Institute, Shepherdstown, WV has begun projects to evaluate the feasibility for rearing Arctic char in recycle systems in southern regions. Information regarding the diseases affecting Arctic char, and of the susceptibilities of char to major infectious salmonid bacterial pathogens is very limited. Renibacterium salmoninarum has been detected and bacterial kidney disease was diagnosed in free ranging, wild populations in the Northwest Territories in Canada. Columnaris disease has been diagnosed in Finland; furunculosis is a significant disease problem in char in Sweden and Finland. Information was obtained from "http:  www.lsc.usgs.gov SPN.asp?StudyPlanNum=01068-07" The main web site for Leetown Science Center Research is at "http:  www.lsc.usgs.gov rescurrent.asp"..

TITLE: Nunavut, Canada, Internet GIS Geoscience Data Compilation. ABSTRACT: The Nunavut Geoscience Data Compilation provides several geoscience data layers in a common coordinate system that may be accessed and manipulated in an OGC-compliant Internet GIS applet. This online geoscience compilation was initiated as a cooperative effort between the Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office, the Geological Survey of Canada, and GeoArctic International Services Ltd. Development was undertaken under the GeoConnections Access program. The purpose of the project was to make general information about the geology of the area easier to obtain, to understand, and to use by providing online geoscience information to northern communities and the general public. The geoscience compilation is a seamless, multi-thematic integrated dataset. Geoscience data layers include bedrock geology, seismic survey lines, and geophysical data. Underlying this information is a topographic base with lakes, drainage, coastlines and elevation and bathymetric data. The number of data layers in the compilation is expected to grow over time. Potential applications include land-use planning and management, education and mineral exploration. All layers in the compilation layers may be loaded into the Internet GIS applet or they may accessed individually. The access interface uses the OGC WMS 1.1.0 protocol. The Internet GIS applet can be accessed through both Netscape and Internet Explorer Web browsers.1. To stimulate mineral exploration, effective land-use planning and management, and northern community capacity building. 2. To demonstrate the use of the OGC WMS 1.1.0 protocol. 3.

TITLE: Determination of natural Fe organic complexes in the surface waters of the Amundsen Sea. ABSTRACT: The distribution and biological availability of Fe is strongly controlled by its physical-chemical speciation within seawater, where colloids and Fe-organic complexes are dominant factors. In order to study the distribution and the biological availability of Fe the natural Fe organic complexes were determined in the surface waters of the Amundsen Sea (300 m). Methods Samples were collected using Go Flo bottles and filtered under ultra-clean conditions in flow benches (class 0). The concentration of iron binding ligands (organic compounds which strongly bind Fe) and their binding strength (conditional stability constant) were studied in 5 size classes here: unfiltered water, 0.2 μm filtered water, < 1000 kDa (Stereapore, Mitsubishi-rayon Co. Ltd, Nishioka and al., 2000, 2005), < 100 kDa and < 10 kDa ultra-filtrated water (Sartorius, Vivaflow 50, Schlosser and Croot, 2008). The left-over fraction from the ultra filtrations (retentates) were also analyzed for dFe and ligand characteristics to ensure a mass balance calculation and validate the ultrafiltration method. The dissolved iron concentrations in all the size fractions (and retentates) were measured (see dFe measurement section) using a chemo luminescence method (FIA) with acidified samples (pH 1.8). Total iron concentrations will be measured 6-12 months after the acidification of the unfiltered sample. Ligand characteristics were determined by using a complexing ligand titration with addition of iron (between 0 and 10 nM of Fe added) in buffered seawater (mixed NH3 NH4OH borate buffer, 5 mM). The competing ligand 'TAC' (2-(2-Thiazolylazo)-p-cresol) with a final concentration of 10 μM was used and the complex (TAC)2-Fe was measured after equilibration (> 15 h) by cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) (Croot and Johansson, 2000). The electrical signal recorded with this method (nA) was converted to a concentration of (TAC)2-Fe (nM). Subsequently, the ligand concentration and the binding strength were estimated using the non-linear regression of the Langmuir isotherm (Gerringa and al., 1995) and a newer "Leo" model currently built up (Gerringa et al, in prep). The voltammetric equipment consisted of a μAutolab potentiostat (Type II and III, Ecochemie, The Netherlands), a mercury drop electrode (model VA 663 from Metrohm). All equipment was protected against electrical noise by a current filter (Fortress 750, Best Power). Sampling statistics 26 stations were sampled on this cruise. These included 14 profiles and 5 stations where different size fractions were analyzed after 4 filtrations with different filter sizes (0.2 μm cut-off, 1000 kDa, 100 kDa and 10 kDa). In addition, 11 Fe Ligand experiments were analyzed. Special attention was given to determine the iron binding ligands before and after incubation with and without artificial ligands in these experiments, to look at the response of algae and the change of the ligand characteristics during the incubations. Preliminary results An average ligand concentration of 0.789 nEq was found on the NBP0901 cruise, varying from 0.2 and 1.6 nEq of Fe. Highest ligand concentrations were found at 10 m depth followed by a minimum at 25 m. Concentrations increased with depth to become rather constant at 200 and 300 m. Low Fe binding strength of the ligands was found at 10 and 25 m in the polynya suggesting freshly produced ligands by organisms (phytoplankton or bacteria) or by a change in the ligand content and characteristics due to the biologic activity (the pool of strong binding ligands may be removed or used). The ratio ligand dissolved iron (Fig. 38) clearly shows differences between the surface water and deeper samples. Very high ratios (10) were found in the surface waters of the Pine Island polynya due to the low dissolved iron concentration and high ligand concentrations. In the deep water (200 and 300 m) of the polynya and the circumpolar deep water upwelling in front of the PIG the ligand dissolved iron ratio was close to 1 indicating a saturation of the ligands by iron and the possibility for iron to be removed from the water column by precipitation..

TITLE: Ras Umm Sidd Coral Oxygen Isotope Data, NOAA NCDC WDC Paleoclimatology. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of Ras Umm Sidd bimonthly coral oxygen isotope data (coral core RUS-95). [Abstract] A 245-year coral oxygen isotope record from the northern Red Sea (Ras Umm Sidd Egypt, ~28 deg. N) in bimonthly resolution is presented. The mean annual coral d18O signal apparently reflects varying proportions of both sea surface temperature and d18Oseawater variability. In conjunction with instrumental observations of climate the coral record suggests for interannual and longer timescales that colder periods are accompanied by more arid conditions in the northern Red Sea but increased rainfall in the southeastern Mediterranean, whereas warmer periods are accompanied by decreased rainfall in the latter and less arid conditions in the northern Red Sea. A ~70-year oscillation of probably North Atlantic origin dominates the coral time series. Interannual to interdecadal variability is correlated with instrumental indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and North Pacific climate variability. The results suggest that these modes contributed consistently to Middle East climate variability since at least 1750, preferentially at a period of ~5.7 years. The coral core was collected in the end of November 1995 in the northern Red Sea at Ras Umm Sidd (27 deg 50.9'N, 34 deg. 18.6'E) in the Ras Mohammed National Park near the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), from a 2.6-m-high coral colony (Porites sp.) growing at a water depth of ~5.5 m. The average annual growth rate of the coral is 1 cm year. The average sampling resolution for oxygen isotope analysis is more than 6 samples per year. The coral chronology is constructed by setting the maximum d18O value in a given year equal to mid-February (consistent with the climatological minimum in sea surface temperature) and assuming a constant coral growth rate between February of every year. Therefore we interpolated linearly between these fixed points for further age assignments. The resulting values were interpolated linearly to six equally spaced values per year, providing a bimonthly resolution. The strong seasonal cycle in d18O was used to count annual layers in the coral, supported by the consistent density banding pattern of low-density band creation during winter and high-density band creation during summer. The coral record extends from fall 1750 to fall 1995. We assigned an age model error of at least 2-3 months to the coral chronology. In addition, we assigned an age model error of + -1 year to the interval 1924-1783 and an additional + -1 year to 1782-1750. Therefore the chronology is assigned a cumulative age model error of less than + -3 years at the bottom of the core..

TITLE: The Global Maritime Boundaries Database (GMBD) CD-ROM. ABSTRACT: The Global Maritime Boundaries Database (GMBD) CD-ROM brings together the claims, limits and boundaries of the world with detailed attribution and documentation so they can be queried and viewed using GIS software. Included in the GMBD are: territorial seas; contiguous, joint development, fishing, and economic zones; potential claim median line solutions, disputed areas, boundary status; and much more. It will be your standard reference for quick access to vital, specific boundary information. General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems had created an interactive CD-ROM that makes these global maritime boundaries data commercially available. General Dynamics started building and maintaining a global environmental GIS in the 1980s to address the research needs of its clients. Until now, graphical portrayal of the claims or agreed boundaries has not been readily available to those involved in marine activities. Third party publishers of claims and boundaries data do not include graphics, portray only one boundary per graphic, or limit their graphics to only the agreed boundaries. The database is key reference tool for manual or automated analyses and can be applied to a vast array of specialty areas including defense, hydrographic surveying, offshore oil and gas exploration, fisheries, telecommunications, marine minerals mining, defense, salvage, shipping, construction, pollution, marine scientific research, marine archaeology, recreation, ocean law, academia, and journalism..

TITLE: Landsat-7 Level-0R WRS-Scene V002. ABSTRACT: The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite on April 15, 1999, marks the addition of the latest satellite to the Landsat satellite series. The Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) Program launched the first of a series of satellites (ERTS 1) in 1972. Part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Earth Resources Survey Program, the ERTS Program and the ERTS satellites were later renamed Landsat to better represent the civil satellite program's prime emphasis on remote sensing of land resources. Landsat satellites 1, 2, and 3 carried the multispectral scanner (MSS) sensor and experimental return beam vidicon cameras. The Landsat-4 satellite carried the MSS and thematic mapper sensors as does the still currently flying Landsat-5 satellite. The sixth satellite in the Landsat series was unsuccessfully launched and did not achieve orbit. The Landsat-7 satellite carries the enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite is part of an ongoing mission to provide quality remote sensing data in support of research and applications activities. Landsat-7 ETM+ sensor data are framed into approximately 183-kilometer by 170-kilometer increments or scenes. The nominal centers for the Landsat-7 scenes map to a global notation system called the Worldwide Reference System (WRS), using Path and Row designators that equate to the satellite's 233-orbit cycle (i.e., the same orbit cycle used for Landsat satellites 4 and 5). The scenes are referred to as WRS scenes. Landsat-7 level-0 data are in their raw form. Calibration parameters, though provided in a calibration parameter file, are not applied. Level-0 data use standard HDF structures. Currently, data are distributed at the single WRS-scene granule level. Distribution of subintervals and partial subintervals is pending. Landsat ETM+ data are distributed in accordance with the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-555, as amended, and related contractual agreements. Landsat ETM+ data also are collected by foreign receiving stations. Purchasers are subject to individual foreign distribution site policy and pricing directives..

TITLE: Mega-Biome Maps for the Mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. ABSTRACT: Most dynamic vegetation models (DGVMs) simulate far fewer PFTs, and hence discriminate far fewer biomes, than the palaeodata allow. In order to facilitate direct comparison with model output, we have grouped the observed biomes into broader units (mega-biomes) on the basis of their structure and functioning. Mega-biomes include: - tropical forest - warm temperate forest - temperate forest - boreal forest - savanna and dry woodland - grassland and dry shrubland - desert - dry tundra - tundra This data set is also available from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison project - Phase II: http:  www-lsce.cea.fr pmip2 synth vegmaps.shtml.

TITLE: Mineral Resources Data System Data Set. ABSTRACT: The Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS) data base, formerly known as the Computerized Resources Information Bank (CRIB), was developed by Dr. James A. Calkins and implemented by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1972. The MRDS compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) was developed from the MRDS data base to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data about mineral deposit sites, including mines, prospects, and occurrences. The MRDS data base became a reference tool for Federal, State, and nongovernment scientists wanting location and descriptive geologic information about mineral deposits. The MRDS data base is continuously updated with new information, and records are modified when applicable. An updated MRDS CD-ROM is issued periodically (i.e., no set schedule) with updated MRDS data base information. Currently, the MRDS CD-ROM contains a data base with 111,955 variable-length records of metallic and nonmetallic worldwide mineral resources (i.e., district and regional sites that were known) as of September 1, 1995. Each data base record contains descriptive information that includes deposit name, location, commodity, deposit description, geologic characteristics, production, reserves, potential resources, and references..

TITLE: IAI-FinalReport_IAI-Final Report_ISP3_018: Effects of species and functional diversity on ecosystem function. ABSTRACT: This dataset refers to the Final Report of the ISP round III project number 018, which has the name "Effects of species and functional diversity on ecosystem function: a comparison between arctic tundra and a temperate grassland shrubland system". This project has the following objectives: 1. To test the idea that a set of average parameters or processes for a functional type of plant species can substitute for detailed knowledge of the parameters or processes of all species in their effect on ecosystem functioning 2. To determine some of the ways in which species or functional-type composition affect ecosystem above-ground and below-ground processes at present. 3. To predict some of the ways in which species and functional-type composition may be affected by climate change, and how these alterations in the vegetation will feed back at the ecosystem level to modify its response to a shifting climate. 4. To test whether our results can be extrapolated to vegetation types which differ in taxonomic composition and species diversity but have similar functional types. The final report for this project can be downloaded from this page (See instructions below).

TITLE: Landsat-7 Level-1 WRS-Scene V002. ABSTRACT: The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite on April 15, 1999, marks the addition of the latest satellite to the Landsat satellite series. The Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) Program launched the first of a series of satellites (ERTS 1) in 1972. Part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Earth Resources Survey Program, the ERTS Program and the ERTS satellites were later renamed Landsat to better represent the civil satellite program's prime emphasis on remote sensing of land resources. Landsat satellites 1, 2, and 3 carried the multispectral scanner (MSS) sensor and experimental return beam vidicon cameras. The Landsat-4 satellite carried the MSS and thematic mapper sensors as does the still currently flying Landsat-5 satellite. The sixth satellite in the Landsat series was unsuccessfully launched and did not achieve orbit. The Landsat-7 satellite carries the enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. The launch of the Landsat-7 satellite is part of an ongoing mission to provide quality remote sensing data in support of research and applications activities. Landsat-7 ETM+ sensor data are framed into approximately 183-kilometer by 170-kilometer increments or scenes. The nominal centers for the Landsat-7 scenes map to a global notation system called the Worldwide Reference System (WRS), using Path and Row designators that equate to the satellite's 233-orbit cycle (i.e., the same orbit cycle used for Landsat satellites 4 and 5). The scenes are referred to as WRS scenes. Landsat-7 level-1R products contain data that have been radiometrically corrected, while level-1G products contain data that have both been radiometrically and geometrically corrected. Level-1R products are distributed in HDF format. Level-1G products are distributed in HDF, FAST-L7A, and GeoTIFF formats. Currently, data are distributed at the single WRS-scene granule level. Distribution of subintervals and partial subintervals is pending. Landsat ETM+ data are distributed in accordance with the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-555, as amended, and related contractual agreements. Landsat ETM+ data also are collected by foreign receiving stations. Purchasers are subject to individual foreign distribution site policy and pricing directives..

TITLE: Global, Hemispheric, and Zonal Temperature Anomalies Derived from Radiosonde Records, in CDIAC Online Trends and NOAA ARL. ABSTRACT: Surface temperatures and thickness-derived temperatures from a 63-station, globally distributed radiosonde network have been used to estimate global, hemispheric, and zonal annual and seasonal temperature anomalies. The data were obtained from differences in height between constant-pressure surfaces at individual radiosonde stations. The pressure-height data before 1980 were obtained from published data in the "Monthly Climatic Data for the World". Since 1980, data was obtained from the "Climatic Data for the World" and the Global Telecommunication System Network received at the National Meteorological Center. All of the data are referenced to a 1958-1977 average. The data consists of the following: Global (90S-90N) North Polar (60N-90N) North Temperate (30N-60N) North Subtropics (10N-30N) Equatorial (10S-10N) South Subtropics (10S-30S) South Temperate (30S-60S) South Polar (60S-90S) Tropical (30S-30N) Northern Hemisphere (0-90N) Southern Hemisphere (0-90S) For each zone the data is expressed in degrees Celsius for winter (December-February), spring (March-May), Summer (June-August), and Fall (September-November) at 3 pressure levels (Surface - 100 mb, 100-50 mb, and 100-30 mb) for each year 1958-2002.

TITLE: Arctic EASE-Grid Freeze and Thaw Depths, 1901 - 2002. ABSTRACT: This data set contains mean, median, minimum and maximum freeze and thaw depths for each year from 1901 to 2002 on the 25 km resolution Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) for areas north of 50 deg. Freeze and thaw depths are estimated using a variant of the Stefan solution using an edaphic factor and freezing or thawing indices as inputs. The edaphic factor is estimated based on different land surface types; the freezing and thawing indices are from Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid annual freezing and thawing indices, 1901 - 2002 (Zhang, et al. 2005). Two ASCII files are available for each year for freeze depth and thaw depth, respectively. Each file is approximately 25.6 MB in size. In addition, there is one 10.5 MB ASCII file defining the latitude and longitude coordinates for each grid point. The data set is available via FTP as three compressed files..

TITLE: Panchromatic all-sky TV data. ABSTRACT: This is a Sino-Japan collaborative observation at Zhongshan Station, Antarctica, which commenced in March 1995 (Principal Investigators: Prof. Natsuo Sato, National Institute of Polar Research and Dr. Huigne Yang, Polar Research Institute of China). The observation system comprises a HARPICON (High-gain Avalanche Rushing Amorphous Photoconductor) TV camera fitted with a fish-eye lens. A HARPICON tube utilizes an amorphous photoconductive selenium target within which an avalanche signal multiplication may be obtained under a high voltage. The exposure time of the observation is set to 2 seconds and a sensitivity of ~6 times higher than that of a conventional SIT tube is achieved. The all-sky TV data are originally recorded on video tapes in NTSC format, which are digitized into AVI files of 320*240 pixels..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Clouds 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and 5km (Collection 004 and 005). ABSTRACT: MODIS was launched aboard the Aqua satellite on May 04, 2002 (1:30 pm equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands), and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at NASA Goddard DAAC and has been made available to public since April 2000. The level-2 MODIS cloud product consists of cloud optical and physical parameters. These parameters are derived using remotely sensed infrared, visible and near infrared solar reflected radiances. MODIS infrared channel radiances are used to derive cloud top temperature, cloud top height, effective emissivity, cloud phase (ice vs. water, opaque vs. non-opaque), and cloud fraction under both daytime and nighttime conditions. MODIS visible radiances are used to derive cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius and cloud shadow effects. Near infrared solar reflected radiance provides additional information in the retrieval of cloud particle phase (ice vs. water, clouds vs. snow). The shortname for this level-2 MODIS cloud product is MYD06_L2 and the principal investigators for this product are MODIS scientists Dr. Bo-Cai Gao ( gao@rsd.nrl.navy.mil) for cirrus cloud detection; Dr. Paul Menzel ( paulm@ssec.wisc.edu) for cloud top properties; and Dr. Michael King( king@climate.gsfc.nasa.gov) for cloud optical properties . The level-2 cloud product (MYD06_L2) consists of 46 gridded cloud parameters. These parameters are produced at a spatial resolution of either 1- km or 5-km (at nadir). Each MYD06_L2 product file covers a five-minute time interval. This means that for 5-km resolution parameters, the output grid is 270 pixels in width by 406 pixels in length. Every tenth granule has an output grid size of 270 by 408 pixels. For 1-km resolution parameters, the output grid is 1354 pixels in width by 2030 pixels in length and every tenth granule has an output grid size of 1354 by 2040 pixels. MYD06_L2 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Forty four of the 46 gridded cloud parameters are stored as Scientific Data Sets (SDS) within the file, the remaining two (band number and statistics) are stored as Vdata(table arrays). Approximately 288 files are produced daily. Nighttime files are smaller than their daytime counterparts since only cloud top properties are retrieved at night. Each daytime file is roughly 65.1 MB in size and each nighttime HDF file roughly 12.4 MB in size, and the total data volume is approximately 12.3 GB day. For browsing and extracting data from these files, some software are made available at the site.

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Yearly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: Canadian Coastal Information System (CIS). ABSTRACT: The Coastal Information System contains detailed information about the geomorphic form and the material composition of the coastal features for segments along the coast. These segments are based upon the division of shorelines from the 1:10,000 to 1:250,000 topographic base maps. The segmentation and attribution of the units was interactively conducted by a coastal geologist through the interpretation of aerial coastal videos and air photographs. The system has data for selected areas of Canada that have been identified to be vulnerable to sea level rise. The data for these areas are presented in map form using Transverse Mercator and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projections.This data is applied to shore-zone description and classification for assessment of coastal stability and hazards, environmental sensitivity and resource inventory. Potential applications are coastal management and planning.

TITLE: RADARSAT Ortho-rectified Mosaic of Canada, Lambert Conformal Conic, 750 Metres. ABSTRACT: The Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) have collaborated with contributions from RADARSAT International (RSI), to create an ortho-rectified RADARSAT-1 mosaic of Canada. Using CSA's RADARSAT data archive, ScanSAR Narrow B descending mode data were selected. The majority of the data, south of 60 degrees was acquired during the growing seasons of 1998 and 1999.

TITLE: Measurements of high amplitude low cycle fatigue of sea ice in conjunction with the characteristic length of sea ice, temperature and salinity profiles and acoustic emissions. ABSTRACT: The high amplitude low cycle fatigue properties of sea ice in situ at high strain were investigated by developing a cantilever system of sea ice beams and using hydraulic equipment to exercise these beams to determine the rheological properties of sea ice in situ. This allows the mechanical behaviour to be determined under a variety of various loading conditions and different ice types (i.e. very cold ice and warm ice). A published constitutive equation for sea ice relates stress, strain and strain rate and measurements were used to test the equations relevance for in situ ice in the hope that it may become used routinely to solve ice engineering and geophysical problems. The characteristic length of sea ice was determined by taking ice cores at various distances apart on an exponential scale (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32....) to know if the properties of ice change over the length of a beam being tested and over an area where a large number of beams are being tested. Temperature and salinity profiles of the ice cores were collected also. Acoustic emissions were monitored in conjunction with the fatigue experiments to determine the nature of the failure of the ice and the relationship between stress and strain in a cantilever beam..

TITLE: North Pole Environmental Observatory PMEL CRREL 2000-2003 Ice Temperature and Mass Balance Buoy Data. ABSTRACT: This data set contains ice temperature and mass balance data from drifting ice buoys near the North Pole in the Central Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Buoys were deployed each April by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). The buoys drifted with the ice pack, and data were collected via satellite transmissions. Ice temperature data were collected year around during 2000-2003, at 10 cm depth intervals twice daily, every twelve hours. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year. More information about the project is available at the project Web site, North Pole Environmental Observatory (http:  psc.apl.washington.edu northpole ). Data are in tab-delimited ASCII text format.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: AVHRR data from Eurimage. ABSTRACT: The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been operating its Advanced Tiros-N (ATN) series of satellites since October 1978. Carrying the Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), a low-data-rate atmospheric sounding package, and the Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), these satellites were designed primarily for meteorological applications, but the AVHRR instrument, in particular, has proved very valuable in a variety of environment linked earth observation applications, such as: drought early warning regional and global vegetation monitoring snow and ice mapping dynamic oceanography hydrology geology detection of forest fires, gas flares and agricultural burning fire fuel mapping volcanology air and sea pollution monitoring toxic algal bloom detection continental scale mapping (less than 1:3,000,000). Eurimage distributes AVHRR data from NOAA, acquired from the TIROS satellites and received mainly at ESA ground stations. Coverage of Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of the Far East is provided, as shown in the sketch map below. With at least two satellites operational at any one time, each with a daily repeat cycle, twice daily and twice nightly coverage is possible for any point on the equator and approximately double this number (8 passes in total) at mid-latitudes.

NOAA maintain at least two operational satellites in complementary orbits, with one crossing the equator at local solar times of approximately 0730 and 1930, and the other at 0230 and 1430. By convention, the even-numbered satellites cover the 'morning orbit' (0730) and the odd-numbered satellites the 'afternoon orbit' (1430). The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer is a four (AVHRR 1) or five (AVHRR 2) channel passive scanning radiometer. It has one visible channel, one near-infrared, one middle-infrared, and one two far-infrared channels. The nominal ground resolution is about 1 km. The extra channel of the AVHRR 2 (Channel 5) affords improved atmospheric correction of sea and land surface temperatures..

TITLE: North Water Polynya Seabird Surveys. ABSTRACT: To relate avian usage of the North Water polynya to the distribution, abundance and production of prey, we assessed seasonal changes in the distribution and relative abundance of seabirds. In order to assess the spatial distribution of seabirds in the North Water, we conducted surveys of seabirds from the bridge of the Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers whenever the icebreakers were underway. Bird specimens were also collected to carry out stable isotope analysis. The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of avian usage of the North Water polynya. We assessed the timing of arrival and the seasonal changes in the at-sea distribution of seabirds in the North Water polynya and related these parameters to oceanographic conditions. Oceanographic variables were collected by collaborators and are not part of this data set. Birds were counted from the bridge of a ship within 300m one side of the ship whenever the ship was underway. Weather conditions and ocean conditions were recorded simultaneously and it was noted when sightability decreased to less than 300m. Position was recorded from ships GPS. Strip width was regularly checked using the Heineman method (Heineman 1981). Ship speed and course and position were recorded regularly. Birds behavior (flying, sitting on the water, feeding) were noted for each bird sighting. Some inconsistencies in the estimation of how much area was surveyed (based on ships speed and course) when ship changed course to avoid ice or had to back up to crash through ice. We conducted surveys from the bridge of Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers whenever the icebreakers were underway; the CCGS Louis St. Laurent in August 1997 and the CCGS Pierre Radisson in April-July 1998 and August-September 1999. We counted all birds within a 300m wide arc from the bow on the side of the ship with the best visibility. Data were entered directly into a notebook computer by the observer. We determined the boundary of the area in which the birds were counted by using the method of Heineman (1981). We noted the birds behavior (Flying, sitting on the water, etc). as well as the ships speed and course. As each bird sighting is entered into the computer, a time stamp is given to each record..

TITLE: Bootstrap Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM I. ABSTRACT: This sea ice concentration data set was derived using measurements from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus-7 satellite and from three Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I) sensors on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSP) -F8, -F11, and -F13 satellites. The data set has been generated using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Bootstrap Algorithm with daily varying tie-points. Daily (every other day prior to July 1987) and monthly data are available for both the north and south polar regions. Data are gridded on the SSM I polar stereographic grid (25 x 25 km) and provided in two-byte integer format. Data are available via FTP. Important Note: The most recent revision (Version 2, released September 2007) has tie-points adjusted to be consistent with the AMSR-E Bootstrap algorithm. This involved a complete reprocessing of the entire SMMR-SSM I time series. Because Version 2 is inter-calibrated with AMSR-E, it is NOT consistent or compatible with the original version of this data set (Version 1). Users should acquire the entire Version 2 data set in order to update their time series..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Mapped 9 KM Cumulative Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the SeaWiFS PAR products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative.

TITLE: MODIS Terra Sea Ice Extent L2 Swath 1km V003. ABSTRACT: Sea ice products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) include level 2 swath data and level 3 gridded day and night composites, at 1 km resolution. Level 3 products consist of tiles of data, approximately 1200 km by 1200 km in area, gridded in a Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (EASE-Grid) projection. The sea ice algorithm uses a Normalized Difference Sea Ice Index (NDSI) and other criteria to distinguish sea ice from open ocean, based on reflective characteristics. The level 2 swath product (MOD293) contains the following fields: Sea Ice by Reflective Characteristics, Sea Ice by Reflective Pixel Quality Assurance (QA), Ice Surface Temperature (IST), IST Pixel QA, Sea Ice by IST, Combined Sea Ice, Latitude, and Longitude. The data also contain local and global metadata. Latitude and longitude geolocation fields are at 5 km resolution, while all other fields are at 1 km resolution. Sea ice data are in HDF-EOS format and are available by ftp. MODIS sea ice products are considered provisional at this time. Product quality may not be optimal, and incremental product improvements are still occurring. This data set represents Version 3 (V003) of the MODIS processing scheme. The V003 collection contains reprocessed V001 data from 5 March 2001 onward and V003 data from 24 May 2001 onward. V003 data contain processing refinements accommodating algorithm, instrument and calibration stabilization. V003 start dates will continually shift to earlier dates as V001 data are reprocessed to V003. After V003 data are generated for a given day, the V001 data for the same day will still be available for ordering through the EOS Data Gateway (EDG) for at least six months. Eventually, V003 data will completely replace V001 data..

TITLE: Land Bird Monitoring Protocols for National Parks in Alaska. ABSTRACT: Purpose: The fieldwork had two primary objectives: (1) quantify interannual variation in the abundance of land birds along the Denali National Park and Preserve (NPP) road corridor. (2) Quantify intra-annual variation in the detection probabilities of breeding landbirds in the Denali NPP road corridor. Abstract: Fieldwork was conducted in Denali National Park and Preserve by Alaska Bird Observatory. In 1996, three observers determined seasonal variation in detection probabilities for breeding birds in the park by conducting 18 BBS-style counts on one On-road route and obtained further estimates of the interannual differences in relative abundance of breeding land birds in the park by resurveying nine Off-road Routes that were surveyed in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and resurveying all four BBS-style routes. Eighty-six taxa were detected in 1996 during systematic surveys, compared to 86 taxa in 1994, and 80 taxa in 1995. As in past years, the greatest species richness was found on the west side of the park, where a wide variety of habitat types exist including some of the only palustrine and lacustrine wetland habitat. Interannual variation data collected from On-road Routes (Breeding Bird Survey-style censuses) showed similar population trends as during Off-road Routes. The abundance of species that were rare (occurred at <2% of all counting stations) tended to fluctuate widely between years, often rare species were not detected in some years. In contrast, the populations of species that were common and widespread exhibited little annual variation, which is a pattern that previous studies in this region of Alaska have found. White-winged Crossbill numbers were relatively low in 1996 during On-road Routes, while Orange-crowned Warbler abundance was greater than in previous years. There was significant seasonal variation in detection probabilities for a number of species. For example, Willow Ptarmigan (a permanent resident) had high detection probabilities only during the first half of May. Most Nearctic migrants arrived in the park by early May, while many short-distance Neotropical migrant species did not arrive until 1 June. Long-distance Neotropical migrant numbers did not peak until 9 June in 1995. Paleotropical migrants (primarily Arctic Warbler) were the last migrants to arrive in the Park, with the first detections on 10 June. Species richness started to decline by 26 June. The peak survey period in the park extended from 10-25 June, as was suggested by the Boreal Partners in Flight working group. Assuming one were attempting to monitor avian populations in Denali NPP with a 90% probability that were detected at > 14% of all survey stations could be adequately monitored with 100 independent counting stations sampled each year. On Off-road Routes in spruce-dominated habitats, 11 taxa met these power calculations criteria in both 1994 and 1995 (Gray Jay, Swainson's Thrush, American Robin, Varied Thrush, Orange-Crowned Warbler, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Wilson's American Tree Sparrow, White-crowned Sparrow, Dark-eyed Junco, and Redpoll sp.). These 11 taxa represent a broad array of migration strategies (e.g., permanent residents, long-distance and short-distance Neotropical migrants, nearctic migrants, and boreal migrants), and should be emphasized for detailed monitoring scheme. Both Off- and On-road routes should continue to be conducted in future years. The minimum amount of sampling that should be conducted on the same nine Off-road Routes (108 total stations) that have been surveyed since 1993; each survey station needs to be visited once per season. In addition, although using frequency (i.e., the proportion of stations with detections) is the primary analysis tool used in this report, we strongly urge that total counts (i.e., the total number of individuals detected at each station) continue to be collected at all survey stations. Virtually all other monitoring programs use total counts to monitor interannual variation in avian abundance, therefore data have to be collected in a format that is comparable to other similar programs. Geographic Description: Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central Alaska Range, approximately 210 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The study area encompassed the Road Corridor which is 1 km on either side of the main park road, 150 km long and extending westward from the park entrance at the Parks Highway (63.73, 148.92) to the airfield near Kantishna (63.53, 151.00). 1.5.2 Bounding Rectangle Coordinates Methodology: Two survey methods were used - Off-road and On-road Routes, to compare avian abundance estimates among years. Off-road Routes sampled birds only in spruce forests in the Park, whereas On-road Routes sampled all habitat types along the Park road corridor. Off-road routes. -- This technique followed the methodology developed by an Alaska Partners in Flight working group. Off-road Routes were 12 point-count stations spaced approximately 250 m apart. One observer surveyed one route per morning by walking between points. These Routes were located only in spruce forest dominated habitats. Forests were defined as habitats where trees (i.e., single-stemmed woody plants >3 m in height) comprised > 10% of the crown cover (Viereck et al. 1992). Forest stands were <0.8 km. from the park road to ease access and had to be large enough to contain the Route (i.e., 2.75 km long by 0.5 km wide). All birds detected at an unlimited distance from counting stations were recorded for a 5-minute period (Blondel et al. 1981, Ralph 1993). Data were subdivided into the number of detections before and after 3-minutes had elapsed. Detection cues were separated into singing, calling, visual, and flying overhead. Detections were further subdivided into those <50 m from counting stations and those >50 m. In 1996, we resurveyed all nine Off-road Routes censused in 1993, 1994, 1995; this resulted in 108 counting stations surveyed. Four of the Routes were located at the east end of the Park road corridor, three were near the middle of the Park, and two were on the west end of the park. Each Route was surveyed only one time per breeding season. Two observers were used for these surveys in 1996, one of whom had conducted observation variation surveys in Denali in 1995. Following guidelines suggested by Verner and Ritter (1986, Dawson 1981), surveys were initiated at official sunrise and took approximately 3 hours to complete. Habitat characteristics at each counting station were quantified following a protocol developed by an Alaska Partners in Flight working group (Handel 1993). Data recorded within 50 m of each counting station included: elevation, aspect, slope, presence and type of water (e.g., pond, river), tree canopy height, % of coniferous trees, % of total tree cover, dominant shrub height, % of total shrub cover, dominant shrub species, dominant ground cover. The primary objective of this habitat analysis was to classify each counting station into habitat categories developed by both Kessel (1979) and Viereck et al. (1992). On-road routes - This technique utilized a methodology developed for the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (Droege 1990). Censuses were conducted along three 39.4 km (24.5 mile) routes and one 29.8 km (18.5 mile) route. Fifty census stations were located along each route, with the exception of the 36 stations on Route #4 (39 stations in 1993, and 37 stations in 1994 and 1995; only 33 stations were surveyed on 6 19 96). Counting stations were spaced 0.8 km (0.5 miles) apart and observers drove between stations, with observers surveying one route per morning. Detections included birds heard (recorded as either singing or calling) or seen from counting stations for a three-minute census period. Birds were recorded at an unlimited distance from counting stations for a three-minute census period. Birds were recorded at an unlimited distance from counting stations. Routes were initiated 1 2 hour before official sunrise, or no earlier than 3:30 AM and took 4-5 hours to complete..

TITLE: Arctic Ocean Snow and Meteorological Observations from Drifting Stations. ABSTRACT: During 1950-1991 the USSR maintained two, and sometimes three, drifting ice stations in the Arctic Ocean. In addition to supporting scientific studies, these manned ice camps operated as synoptic meteorological stations reporting position, surface weather, atmospheric soundings, solar radiation, and snow conditions. Data from these drifting stations are daily averages, or 3-hourly measured values. Observations were made throughout the Arctic basin with a spatial resolution dependent on the movement of the drifting ice floes on which the stations were located. The data are presented on 1 CD-ROM in many small ASCII files totalling 73 mbytes. Fortran formats are listed in the documentation for each file type. Some files are comma-delimited tables. Documentation files are ASCII (text) files; PostScript versions of two data reports (see References) are included on the CD-ROM, with .GIF files containing figures. Though these data were regularly transmitted over the GTS (Global Telecommunication System of the World Meteorological Organization) and archived at various institutions, the primary source for this data compilation is the original meteorological log books, presently archived at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia. As a continuation and expansion of cooperative agreements between AARI and the Polar Science Center (PSC) at the University of Washington in Seattle, AARI digitized, organized, and quality checked the data, PSC further organized and quality checked the data, linearly interpolated the position data where necessary to fill gaps in the sporadic observations during the early years, and processed all observations into the daily averaged "combined" data file. NSIDC organized the files and documentation for CD-ROM production, and is distributing the CD-ROM. GeoVu, a menu-driven data display and visualization software package from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), can be used with the CD-ROM. GeoVu for Unix and Macintosh is available via ftp from NGDC at "ftp:  ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov", in the directory Solid_Earth Access_Tools GeoVu. The data files do not work with the PC version of GeoVu (see note in section on "Quality".) The first drifting station was NP-1, operating from 1937-05-22 through 1938-02-19. NP-2 began on 1950-04-22, and at least one station, sometimes two, operated from that date until the end of NP-31 on 1991-03-31. One station was continuously operated for 8.5 years; the average duration was 2.4 years. Additional snow data from Arctic coastal stations may become available in the near future.

TITLE: North American Bird Banding Retrieval Files. ABSTRACT: Purpose: Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of facilitating migratory bird research in North America. Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to help set federal hunting regulations. In addition, many states and provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game and non-game studies. Both banding and encounter data can be combined with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival, mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters. Abstract: Bird banding is a universal and indispensable technique for studying the movement, survival and behavior of birds. Data is collected by numerous permitted individuals in both countries. The North American Bird Banding Program is jointly administered by the U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources Division and the Canadian Wildlife Service. Their respective banding offices have similar functions and policies and use the same bands, reporting forms and data formats. Joint coordination of the program dates back to 1923. In the U.S., the Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) at Laurel, Maryland, functions as a service and administrative center for those who use the banding technique or banding data in their work. BBL issues permits and bands, supplies forms, instructional materials and technical advice, coordinates the use of auxiliary markers such as colored leg bands and radio transmitters, serves as the repository for banding data, serves as the clearinghouse for reports of banded birds, disseminates banding data to researchers and managers, and assists in the development and coordination of banding projects. BBL edits and inputs data into its Banding Encounter Database. Supplementary Information: The numerical codes in the data can be translated with the aid of the Banding Manual (described in the section 1.15 Cross Reference). Status code in the first column indicates that something was done to the bird upon recapture that changed the original status. Geographic Description: Includes range of North American species. Range includes breeding, wintering and migration locations. Wintering ranges can include South America, Africa, Europe. Breeding can occur as far north as the Arctic. However, the species being studied are North American species. Methodology: There are numerous, highly variable techniques in bird banding and encounters. bird banding and encounters.

TITLE: Arctic Ostracode Database. ABSTRACT: The Arctic Ostracode Database provides species census data for about 100 species of benthic marine Ostracoda from modern surface and late Quaternary sediments from various parts of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. This readme file describes the sources of the ostracode data provided in the four accompanying data files. Ostracodes are a microfossil group of bivalved Crustacea that secrete a calcareous shell commonly preserved in sediments in the Arctic region. Because many ostracode species have ecological limits controlled by temperature, salinity, oxygen, food and other factors, they can provide an important tool for paleoceanographic reconstruction in the Arctic. Some recent applications of ostracodes to understanding Arctic Ocean history include Briggs (1983), Reimnitz et al. (1983, 1992), McDougall et al. (1986), Clark et al. (1990), Pak et al. (1992), Brouwers et al. (1991), Cronin et al. (1993, 1994, 1995), Penney (1993a,b), Nurnberg et al. (1994), and Briggs and Mudie (in prep.)..

TITLE: Birds Oiled at Sea. ABSTRACT: Summary: Oil released at sea, whether from chronic operational discharges or accidental spills, can directly kill any seabird that it touches on the sea surface. This oiling causes severe distress for individual birds and can have significant impacts at the population level. Marine oil pollution from chronic operational discharges is both illegal and preventable. The costs of taking appropriate action to prevent such discharges make it important to quantify, to the degree possible, the severe ecological consequences of continuing to release oil into the sea. Atlantic Canada is an important crossroads for seabirds, where productive marine waters support the tens of millions of birds. Huge numbers of birds from Newfoundland breeding colonies overlap with millions of seasonal visitors - wintering birds from colonies in Arctic Canada and Europe and from the south Atlantic. The same waters serve as commercial fishing grounds and major shipping lanes linking Europe and North America. For the waters off southeastern Newfoundland, the many variables that must be considered to complete these complicated calculations have been assembled for the species most commonly found oiled - the Thick-billed Murre, or turr. This species breeds in colonies in the eastern Canadian Arctic and western Greenland, and is one of the most numerous wintering seabirds in waters off Newfoundland and northern Nova Scotia. It is regionally important as the most common species taken in the Newfound-land turr hunt. Waterbody or Watershed Names: Atlantic Ocean, Canada Purpose: Assessing the numbers of seabirds killed by oil at sea. Only a small proportion of birds killed by oil are actually found on shore, because many never reach land, instead being carried offshore or sinking. Others may reach the shore but are never found, instead becoming buried in the beach, decomposing or being carried off by scavengers. Estimates of the actual number of birds dying at sea are derived using an approach that sequentially builds in the following information: -the number of oiled birds found washed ashore on beaches, -the length of time that carcasses of oiled birds remain on a beach, -the length of time that an oiled bird carcass floats at sea before sinking, -the proportion of those birds that die at sea which drift towards shore, and -the size of the ocean area being considered, where ship-source oil pollution and seabirds overlap, resulting in the risk of oiling to seabirds.

TITLE: Taxonomically comprehensive assessment of biodiversity of animal plankton throughout the world ocean. ABSTRACT: The Census of Marine Zooplankton (CMarZ) is a field project of the Census of Marine Life (see http:  www.CoML.org ). CMarZ will work toward a taxonomically comprehensive assessment of biodiversity of animal plankton throughout the world ocean. The project goal is to produce accurate and complete information on zooplankton species diversity, biomass, biogeographical distribution, genetic diversity, and community structure. Our taxonomic focus is the animals that drift with ocean currents throughout their lives. This assemblage currently includes ~6,800 described species in fifteen phyla; our expectation is that at least that many new species will be discovered as a result of our efforts. The census will encompass unique marine environments and those likely to be inhabited by endemic and undescribed zooplankton species. A distributed database - fully integrated with and searchable from the Ocean Biogeographical Information System (OBIS) portal - contains species-level, specimen-based, geo-referenced entries. Molecular analysis will include determining a DNA barcode (i.e., reference DNA sequence) for each species; describing genetic diversity and structure of populations and species, identifying cryptic species, and reconstructing their evolutionary histories..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Yearly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Breeding ecology of skuas on Barton peninsula, King George Island, the Antarctic. ABSTRACT: The ratio of breeding pairs of brown skuas, south polar skuas and mixed species pairs between Barton and Weaver peninsulas were not different (Ç2-test, Ç2=0.503, df=2, p=0.778). The nests of skuas were clustered on Barton, whereas distributed randomly on Weaver peninsula. The distance of between brown skua (Catharacta lonnbergi) nests , and that of mixed species pair nests were longer than that of south polar skua (C. maccormicki) nests . Brown skua nests were distributed along the coast. Whereas, the nests of mixed species pairs and south polar skuas were found more frequently inland (Kruskal-Wallis, Ç2=11.631, df=2, p<0.005). There was no interspecific difference in the distances between skua nests and Penguin rookery in Barton (Kruskal-Wallis, Ç2=2.153, df=2, p=0.341) and in King Sejong Station (ANOVA, F=1.483, df=2, p=0.229). In general, skuas prefer lower site (<125m above sea level) as their nest building sites. Brown skua nests were distributed mainly on the beach, whereas south polar skua ones were distributed on the predominant periglacial landforms and till areas (Ç2-test, Ç2=24.988, df=8, p<0.005)..

In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400,000 years (400 kyr) (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). The dates were determined through an analysis of air bubbles trapped in the ice core. The data has been extended back to 417.160 years before present. The ice core data is available online from CDIAC at: "http:  cdiac.esd.ornl.gov trends co2 vostok.htm".

TITLE: National Scale Frameworks Hydrology - Drainage Network, Canada. ABSTRACT: Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data are standardized national coverages of commonly used geospatial data sets at the 1:1 000 000 scale. A variety of framework layers (e.g. hydrology, roads, railways, populated places) have been integrated so that their relative positions are correct. Hydrology (which includes coastline) is the base layer to which all others are fitted. In addition, the Atlas of Canada National Frameworks collection forms a base to which an increasing number of national scale thematic frameworks from other Federal Government agencies are integrated (e.g. ecological regions, census subdivisions). The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers, lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada. The product set for the hydrology theme consists of six groupings: - Drainage Network Skeleton - Waterbodies - Islands - Drainage Areas - Supplemental Drainage Features (Catchments, Hydrometric Gauging Stations, Station Basins) - Cartographic This metadata applies to the Drainage Network Skeleton, Waterbodies, Islands and Cartographic groups of featutes, of the hydrology theme. The Drainage Network Skeleton dataset is comprised of linear features: single line rivers, flow lines within waterbodies and ocean coastlines. Flow lines within waterbodies are virtual linear features representing the hydrological flow through area features (e.g. lakes, rivers and intermittent waterbodies). These flow lines complete the linear network where rivers would run through lakes, permitting hydrologic network analysis and cartographic generalization. This dataset is required for analytical applications. The coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton also delineates oceanic islands. The Waterbodies dataset is comprised of area features: lakes, intermittent waterbodies, islands, and rivers wide enough to be represented as an area feature (e.g. St. Lawrence River, Mackenzie River). In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by "holes" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some area features have been subdivided and several types of virtual linear features serve to separate them. Features in this dataset are linked (by an attribute) to their corresponding flow line in the Drainage Network Skeleton. Therefore the Waterbodies dataset may be used in conjunction with the Drainage Network Skeleton for analytical applications. The Islands dataset is comprised of area and linear features: islands within inland waters and the waterbodies and single line rivers within these islands. Oceanic islands are not included as they are part of the coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton dataset. The Islands dataset exists to complete the cartographic representation of Canadian hydrology. The Islands dataset is not logically connected with the Drainage Network Skeleton, and can not be used for analytical applications. It should be noted that flow lines of the Drainage Network Skeleton do not take into account the existence of islands and therefore do not necessarily flow around them. In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by "holes" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some islands themselves contain waterbodies and rivers, not significant for network analysis. However, in order to support a complete cartographic representation such waterbodies and rivers have been added to the Islands dataset. The Cartographic dataset is suitable for cartographic or display purposes, but not for analysis. It is a selection of features from the waterbodies, islands and drainage network skeleton datasets but does not include flow lines or other virtual features. The attributes of this data are a duplicate of the data selected from other dataset and are not repeated in this document.The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

TITLE: Scandanavia (SCAND) Teleconnection Patterns from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. ABSTRACT: [Source: NOAA Climate Prediction Center, http:  www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov  ] The Scandinavia pattern (SCAND) consists of a primary circulation center which spans Scandinavia and large portions of the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia. Two additional weaker centers with opposite sign to the Scandinavia center are located over western Europe and over the Mongolia  western China sector. The Scandinavia pattern is a prominent mode of low frequency variability in all months except June and July, and has been previously referred to as the Eurasia-1 pattern by Barnston and Livezey (1987). The positive phase of this pattern is associated with positive height anomalies, sometimes reflecting major blocking anticyclones, over Scandinavia and western Russia, while the negative phase of the pattern is associated with negative height anomalies over these regions. The time series for the Scandinavia pattern also exhibits relatively large interseasonal, interannual and interdecadal variability. For example, a negative phase of the pattern dominated the circulation from early 1964 through mid-1968 and from mid-1986 through early 1993. Negative phases of the pattern have also been prominent during winter 1988 89, spring 1990, and winter spring 1991 92. In contrast, positive phases of the pattern were observed during much of 1972, 1976 and 1984..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Weekly Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of algorithm estimates of global Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) reaching the surface obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS data products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html PAR is defined as the quantum energy flux from the Sun in the spectral range 400-700 nm. It is expressed in Einstein m2 day. The PAR model uses plane-parallel theory and assumes that the effects of clouds and clear atmosphere can be de-coupled. The planetary atmosphere is therefore modeled as a clear sky atmosphere positioned above a cloud layer. This approach was shown to be valid by Dedieu et al. (1987) and Frouin and Chertock (1992). For additional information about the algorithm see http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) is stored in two HDF files. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period; and a subordinate file, which contains the accumulated PAR data for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Seasonal Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Environmental Atlas of the Beaufort Coastlands, Canada. ABSTRACT: The Environmental Atlas of the Beaufort Coastlands has been prepared by staff of the Geological Survey of Canada in collaboration with several external agencies, including Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the National Energy Board of Canada. The Canadian Hydrographic Service, the Canadian Wildlife Service, Meteorological Service of Canada, and the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing have also contributed. This Atlas is supplemental to the Marine Science Atlas of the Beaufort Sea (Vol. 1 Sediments; Vol. 2 Geology and Geophysics) produced by the Geological Survey of Canada. It provides information on the environment and its protection, thus supporting the efforts of those developing and harvesting the natural resources, and helping to ensure that an awareness for the preservation of a native way of life is maintained. A major concern in the western Arctic region of Canada is the impact that global warming will have on the environment. This Atlas presents some of the baseline information to which future changes may be compared. The Atlas also highlights many environmental aspects, including permafrost, coastal erosion and wildlife, that may be particularly sensitive to climatic changes.This Atlas provides background on the physical environment. Furthermore, it is designed to show the relationship of wildlife to the physical aspects of the coastlands, with a view toward understanding the former as a sustainable resource for the people of the region.

TITLE: The Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE), Including Halley Bay Ozonesonde Data on CD-ROM. ABSTRACT: This CD-ROM contains data pertaining to the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE) which was based in Punta Arenas, Chile during August and September 1987. The data was primarily collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft which flew into the ozone hole, along with ozonesonde data collected from April through November at 4 Antarctic stations--Halley Bay, McMurdo, Palmer Station, and the South Pole. The experiment tested the chemical and dynamical theories of the ozone hole using the aircraft data in theoretical computer models of the chemistry and dynamics of the stratosphere. The mission was organized and funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, universities, Chemical Manufacturer's Association, and meteorological agencies overseas. The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude research aircraft that sampled air at those altitudes where the ozone hole was at its most intense, with data gathered on the air mass within the confines of the hole itself. The ER-2 collected information on three-dimensional winds, pressure, temperature, temperature profiles + - 1 km from flight level, chlorine monoxide, bromine monoxide, ozone, nitric oxide, reactive nitrogen, total water, nitrous oxide, whole air sampling, condensation nuclei, aerosol size distribution and composition, and cloud particle images and sizes. The DC-8 aircraft flew at the lowermost extremities of the hole and deployed a combination of remote sounding of the overlying atmosphere with some in situ sampling. Vertical distributions of ozone and aerosols above the cruising altitude of the aircraft and within the hole were mapped. The DC-8 collected ozone and aerosol profiles overhead by LIDAR; and measured ozone, bromine oxide, OClO, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, and hydrogen chloride. In situ methods yielded ozone, total water, and whole air sampling. This CD-ROM also contains the results of the ozonesonde program at Halley Bay (76 degrees South, 27 degrees West) in 1987, where one file corresponds to one ozonesonde ascent. Instances of abnormal conditions affecting the data are noted. All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable length records. The file naming convention uses a two character prefix to identify the instrument followed by a six digit number giving the year, month, and day (GMT) of the flight (or balloon launch). A three character name as in ER2, DC8, or OZn is used to denote the data is from either the ER-2, DC-8, or ozonesonde (OZ1 for the first launch, OZ2 for the second launch on a particular day)..

TITLE: Polar Open Forum for junior and high school children. ABSTRACT: The International Council for Science (ICSU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) are planning an International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007~2008 to mark the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). A variety of international research organizations have announced their participation and submitted proposals for Arctic and Antarctic research. During the IPY, the Science Council of Japan and NIPR are planning to hold a Polar Open Forum for junior and high school aged children in order to awaken interest in polar studies in the next generation. The catchphrase of the forum will be “Arctic and Antarctic Proposals from School Children.” NIPR called for polar research proposals from school children and held a meeting to announce the winning proposals. The research in the winning proposal will be carried out by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) and the Arctic Research Group, and the results reported to the school that submitted the proposal..

TITLE: Daily Mesosphere Wind Estimates (Meteor Winds) by Fourier Analysis for Stations in Antarctica, Arctic Ocean, and Europe. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of meridional and zonal daily winds accompanied with hourly meteor rates, as measured by ground-based meteor radar. The hourly winds were obtained at the height interval of 92-95 km using meteor radars with no angle gauges. The data were recorded at Molodezhnaya (Antarctica), Heiss Island (Arctic Ocean), Obninsk, USSR, and Khulungsborn, Germany. Radar characteristics include wave length = 9m, peak power = 50-70 kw, pulse length = 20-30 mks, pulse repetition = 500 pps, sensitivity = 2-3 mkv, 5-elements yagi antennae, and beam width = 35 degrees. The data coverage for the 4 stations spans 5 years. The term 'meteor wind' is used for the mesosphere wind estimates derived from meteor trail drifts measurements. Ionized meteor trails are produced by meteoroids (meteor particles) which enter the Earth's atmosphere. A meteor trail moves in the atmosphere due to the neutral wind and magnetic field. The radial component of this movement is measured using meteor radar. Estimates of 'meteor wind' are derived for each direction (North, South, East, West) from the set of measurements of radial components using statistical characteristics of meteor parameter distributions and parameters of antenna pattern. The 'hourly meteor rate' which is the number of registered meteors for which reliable estimates of radial components can be obtained can also be determined. Meteoroids occur in the height interval 80-100 km and are centered at 92-95 km (maximum for the apex time, near 6 a.m. LT, and minimum for anti-apex time, near 6 p.m. LT ). A set of hourly 'meteor wind' estimates for each day is processed using a conventional Fourier procedure which produces estimates of a constant term associated with the prevailing wind, and four harmonics (variances), associated with diurnal, semidiurnal, 8-hour and 6-hour components of wind. Each component (being a random value) is accompanied with an estimate of sample standard deviation. The derived prevailing wind is not climatological as it varies from day to day..

TITLE: Acidic Tussock Tundra Model Output from MBL-GEM for Toolik Lake, 1921-2144, and the Kuparuk River Basin, 1995. ABSTRACT: This data set contains model input and output data for four simulations of varying time periods and spatial coverage. The first two simulations are for acidic tussock tundra in the Toolik Lake region of the Kuparuk River watershed for the years 1921 to 2144. Each of these simulations is made up of two parts. The first part is based upon a reconstruction of historical climate variables from 1921 to 1995, while the second part is based upon a doubling of C02 and the concurrent changes in temperature, soil moisture, and irradiance from 1996 to 2144. The historical period is the same for both simulations. The future period differs between the two simulations: One simulation assumes a direct relationship between soil moisture and temperature (i.e., warmer and wetter), and the other assumes an inverse relationship between soil moisture and temperature (i.e., warmer and drier). The climate drivers used for the simulations are included as part of this dataset. The second two simulations are for acidic tussock tundra throughout the entire Kuparuk River basin for 1995 only. The first simulation uses the reconstructed 1995 climate. The second simulation uses the same climate with an increase in soil moisture. The model output data consist of 34 variables including photosynthesis, plant and soil respiration, net primary production, net mineralization, and carbon and nitrogen stocks in plant tissues and soils..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Binned 4 KM Seasonal Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  Each Aqua MODIS Level-3 binned (4 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a season, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells have a resolution of 4.6x4.6km. Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product.

TITLE: CODAR Real time vector fields: standard. ABSTRACT: CODAR is used to measure the surface currents of the coastal ocean. A transmitter sends out a radio frequency that bounces off the ocean surface and back to a receiver antenna. Using this information and the principles of the Doppler shift, CODAR is able to calculate the speed and direction of the surface current. These calculations are made at about every half mile across the surface and extend as far as about twenty miles offshore. The following Data is available online: Raw Vector Field: The raw surface current is the unprocessed data measured by CODAR. Therefore these velocity fields are the summation of all sources of current, including tides and wind. Tidal Vector Field: This vector field represents the component of the raw velocity that is caused by tidal forcing. Detided Vector Field: The detided vector field contains all the surface currents shown in the raw velocity field with the exception of the tidal currents. Using the above periods, a predicted tide is calculated and then subtracted from the raw data field. Low-pass Vector Field: The low-pass surface current field is representative of the second step of data processing. A low-pass filter is applied to the detided data to further eliminate any other currents with a period less than 30 hours. The data is delayed three hours because the filter needs information up to three hours after the time of calculation. High-pass Vector Field: These high frequency currents are calculated by subtracting the low-pass field from the detided field. Therefore, These currents have periods less than thirty hours and do not include the tides..

TITLE: Summer Surface Hydrographic Measurements in the Laptev Sea, 1980 to 2000. ABSTRACT: The data set compiled here consists of surface hydrographic data, including temperature and salinity, from the Laptev Sea. Data were collected during the summers of 1980 to 2000. The Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg collected the data through a Russian-German collaboration. Researchers used different thermometers and salinometers during the study, with minimum accuracy within 0.05 degrees C or 0.05 psu. Temperature and salinity were measured within the surface layer (<1 m depth). Because of restrictions in the release of data within the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and as specified in the original proposal, data have been interpolated to a regular grid. Data are in ASCII format, and are available via FTP..

TITLE: Coastal Waterbird Community Structures in the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia, during spring and fall in 1999 - 2004. ABSTRACT: This data set contains coastal waterbird survey data 1999 - 2004 in the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia. It covers waterbird information (relative abundance), collected with beach scans, percent scans and transect surveys along to the coastal areas of the study area. Areas that were surveyed are: Northern Sakhalin Island, Eastern Sakhalin Island, Southern Sakhalkin Island, West Kamchatka and Magadan region. These are either accessible beaches (sand and gravel) or estuaries. Some areas have received a repeated survey effort over years and seasons (spring and fall). Survey locations are few for the large coastline but consist among the best available information for this region. Coastal seabird surveys were carried out using beach scans, percent scans, and transect surveys. Surveys were done by one person (Falk Huettmann, Mike Suitor for Iturup and Sakhalin 2004). Beach scans are 360° scans of an area as far as the naked eye can detect species. These scans are snapshots in time. Percent scans were done where seabird flocks were large. The percentages of the species and their age classes were identified; for larger flocks, numbers were estimated. When noted, transect surveys were conducted along beaches. In this instance the shoreline was followed at a constant even pace along the waters edge representative for the beach. Seabirds were classified to species and age class; moult and gender information was only sometimes possible. In all surveys, binoculars were used to confirm the identities and age of seabirds. Waterbirds were scanned for leg flegs, wing tags and other marks. Data were collected in the field on paper and notebooks, and in the office coded and transcribed, and then checked on hard copy and Excel spread sheets. Data were pre-processed by Falk Huettmann and Mike Suitor, and finalized by Jana Kotzerka and checked by Mike Suitor and Daisuke Kawai. Species identification and bird numbers are done by Falk Huettmann and Mike Suitor (for data 2004)..

TITLE: Arctic Coastal Dynamics Program. ABSTRACT: The Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD) program is a multidisciplinary, multinational program with the goal of understanding circum-Arctic coastal dynamics as a function of environmental forcing, coastal geology and cryology, and morphodynamic behavior. The ACD program was formed under the auspices of the International Permafrost Association (IPA), and is an official project of the International Arctic Sciences Committee (IASC). The ACD program is currently focused on developing a circum-Arctic estimate of sediment and organic input from coastal erosion to inner shelf. Studies indicate that coastal erosion forms a major source of the sediment input and total organic carbon (TOC) input to the Arctic seas..

TITLE: North American Bird Encounter Retrieval File. ABSTRACT: Purpose: Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of facilitating migratory bird research in North America. Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to help set federal hunting regulations. In addition, many states and provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game and nongame studies. Both banding and encounter data can be combined with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival, mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters. Abstract: The Encounter Retrieval File contains records of banded birds that have been encountered, subsequent to any capture, and reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory. Encounter data include the associated banding data. All encounters for game and nongame from 1908 through the current cut-off date (August of each year) are included. Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of facilitating migratory bird research in North America. Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to help set federal hunting regulations. In addition, many states and provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game and nongame studies. Both banding and encounter data can be combined with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival, mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters. The Encounter Retrieval file contains close to 3 million records. The file increases annually by approximately 55,000 records. The Encounter Retrieval File contains limited records of recaptured birds. Encounter Data are displayed in the following order: band number, replaced band, date recovered (month-date-year), how obtained, who reported, present condition, why reported, batch number, where recovered (region, latitude, longitude, direction code), permit number, species number, status, additional information, age, sex, where banded (region, latitude, longitude, direction code), date banded (month-date-year), band type, date cycle processed, hunting seasons survived. A file format is included with all disks to assist the user in separating the fields. Listings have the fields separated and identified. The Encounter File includes entire range of North American species. Range includes breeding, wintering and migration locations. Wintering ranges can include South America, Africa, Europe. Breeding can occur as far north as the Arctic. However, the species being studied are North American species.

TITLE: U. Road Network Files, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: Road Network Files (RNFs) contain a road layer for the entire country and a province territory boundary layer. The road layer includes roads, with road names and address ranges (arc attributes), and geographic codes to identify blocks, census subdivisions, census metropolitan areas census agglomerations, and provinces territories (polygon attributes). Address ranges are mainly available in the large urban centres of Canada. The province territory boundary layer incorporates hydrography (the shoreline around Canada and the larger inland lakes) with the boundaries and the geographic codes. The digital coordinates are in latitude longitude and are based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Road Network Files are available for Canada, for individual provinces and territories, and for census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and those census agglomerations (CAs) with census tracts. A reference guide is included (92F0157GIE). Note: The Road Network Files replace the Street Network Files (SNFs), which were a similar product previously available only for the large urban centres of Canada. RNFs contain more roads, road names and address ranges than SNFs. Coordinates: Latitude Longitude (NAD83) Format: ARC INFO Interchange, and MapInfo Interchange for Windows. Catalogue number for CD-ROM is: 92F0157XCE01000 ...for additional information visit our organization's web site.The Road Network Files are released as a geographic reference for the 2001 Census data. The Road Network Files, in conjunction with Statistics Canada data, can be used for applications such as site location analysis, planning of service delivery or various types of data analysis and mapping. Road Network Files are maintained to support census and other Statistics Canada activities and therefore topological accuracy takes precedence over absolute positional accuracy. Thus the positional accuracy of the RNFs does not support cadastral, surveying or engineering applications. RNFs can be used with Cartographic Boundary Files to provide additional geographic reference information.

TITLE: Study of the glacial system of Livingston Island. Terrestrial photogrammetry on the glacial system of Livingston Island.. ABSTRACT: In English: The aim of this project is to understand the dynamics of the glacial system of Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Source data are obtained both from remote sensing techniques and field work. Remote sensing data: Geometrical correction and comparison of a set of satellite images and air photographs show that there has been a 4% diminution in the area of the Livingston Island ice cap from 1956 to 1991. To understand the dynamics of such a fast retreat of the ice front, field work studies on mass balance and ice flow dynamics are needed. Field work: During the 1994 1995 field-work season, we mainly worked on the portion of the glacial system that calves at Johnson Dock to get first estimates about mass balance and ice flow.Ice flow dynamics: 17 stakes have been planted to be used as markers. Measurement of the position of the stakes by using a theodolite indicated that, during the period of observations (2 months), the downward movement ranged up to 5 m. in the frontal parts of the glacier whereas ice movement close to the glacial divide was below measurements errors. Mass balance: Some permanent stakes have been installed to measure ablation and accumulation rates through the following years. We recovered 11 continuous ice-cores (to a maximum depth of 16.22 m.) to be analysed for artificial radioactive elements by M. Pourchet (Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environment). The aim of these techniques is to determine the depth at which the ice-layers formed synchronously to the atomic test of the 1950 and 1960 decades. Samples of ash layers interstratified in ice have been collected to be analysed geochemically, with the purpose of correlating them with the well dated recent volcanic eruptions in the nearby Deception Island. A detailed stratigraphy of the ash layers cropping out at the coastal ice-front of Livingston Island is currently being made by using stereoscopic photographs and theodolite measurements. To achieve the aims of this project, it is extremely important to repeat observations and measurements during the next years. The reliability of the results to be obtained strongly depends on getting data through a sufficiently long span of time. En Espanol: El objetivo de este proyecto es entender la dinamica del sistema glaciar de la Isla Livingston (Islas Shetland del Sur, Antartida). Se obtuvieron fuentes de datos con tecnicas de sensores remotos y trabajo de campo. Datos de sensores remotos: la correccion geometrica y comparacion de series de imagenes digitales y fotografias aereas muestran que ha habido un 4% de disminucion en la cubierta de hielo de la Isla Livingston entre 1956 y 1991. Para entender la dinamica de esta rapida regresion del frente de hielo, estudios de campo de balance de masas y dinamica de flujo del hielo son necesarios. Trabajo de campo: Durante el trabajo de campo de la temporada 1994 1995 trabajamos principalmente en la porcion del sistema glaciar que parte de Johnson Dock a las primeras estimaciones del balance de masas y flujo de hielo. Dinamica del flujo de hielo: se plantaron 17 estacas para ser usadas como marcadores. Las medidas de la posicion de las estacas se hicieron con un teodolito que ind icaron que, durante el periodo de observaciones (2 meses) el movimiento descendente se alineo a 5 m. en las partes frontales del glaciar mientras que el movimiento del hielo cerca del glaciar era por debajo de las medidas de los errores. Balance de masas: se instalaron algunas estacas permanentes para medir la ablacion y tasa de acumulacion en los siguientes anos. Recuperamos 11 centros de hielo (a una profundidad maxima de 16.22 m) para ser analizados por elementos radiactivos artificiales por M. Pourchet (Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environment). El objetivo de esta tecnica es determinar la profundidad a la cual las capas de hielo se formaron sincronicamente con la prueba atomica de la decada de 1950 y 1960. Muestras de capas de cenizas interestratificadas en el hielo han sido recogidas para ser analizadas geoquimicamente, con el proposito de correlacionarlas con las erupciones volcanicas correctamente datadas recientemente cerca de la isla Decepcion. Una detallada estratigrafia de las capas de ceniza aflorando en el frente de hielo de la costa de la Isla Livingston esta siendo actualmente hecha usando fotografias estereoscopicas y medidas de teodolitos. Para llevar a cabo los objetivos de este proyecto es extremadamente importante repetir las observaciones y medidas durante los proximos anos. La fiabilidad de los resultados obtenidos depende fuertemente de que la obtencion de datos se haga a lo largo de un espacio de tiempo suficientemente largo..

TITLE: Hypothesized Climate Forcing Time Series for the Last 500 Years. ABSTRACT: [from NOAA NCDC WDC Paleoclimatology] A new compilation of annually resolved time series of atmospheric trace gas concentrations, solar irradiance, tropospheric aerosol optical depth, and stratospheric (volcanic) aerosol optical depth is presented for use in climate modeling studies of the period 1500 to 1999 A.D. Atmospheric CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations over this period are well established on the basis of fossil air trapped in ice cores and instrumental measurements over the last few decades. Estimates of solar irradiance, ranging between 1364.2 and 1368.2 W m2, are presented using calibrated historical observations of the Sun back to 1610, along with cosmogenic isotope variations extending back to 1500. Tropospheric aerosol distributions are calculated by scaling the modern distribution of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol optical depths back to 1860 using reconstructed regional CO2 emissions; prior to 1860 the anthropogenic tropospheric aerosol optical depths are assumed to be zero. Finally, the first continuous, annually dated record of zonally averaged stratospheric (volcanic) optical depths back to 1500 is constructed using sulfate flux data from multiple ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica, in conjunction with historical and instrumental (satellite and pyrheliometric) observations. The climate forcings generated here are currently being used as input to a suite of transient (time dependent) paleoclimate model simulations of the past 500 years. These forcings are also available for comparison with instrumental and proxy paleoclimate data of the same period..

TITLE: Mass balance measurements and glacier monitoring of glaciers in the Dry Valleys. ABSTRACT: Glaciers of the Dry Valleys occur where snow accumulation gains exceed sublimation and other losses. Monitoring of the mass balance of glaciers in the Dry Valleys was conducted from the 1969 70 summer until the 1990 91 season. The data was used to contribute to the understanding of the mass balance of the glacier-river-lake systems in the Dry Valleys because these fluctuations are indicators of climate change in this part of Antarctica. Mass balances, ablation and other measurements were measured since 1969 on several glaciers within the Dry Valleys including the Sykes, Alberich, Heimdall, Upper Wright, Lower Wright, Clarke, Meserve, Bartley, Hart, Goodspeed, Denton and the Wilson Piedmont Glaciers in the Wright Valley, the Upper Victoria, Lower Victoria and Packard Glaciers in the Victoria Valley, the Upper Taylor, La Croix, Suess, Canada and Commonwealth Glaciers in the Taylor Valley and the Miers and Adams Glaciers in the Miers Valley. Not all measurements were made at each glacier in each season. Arrays of stakes were re-measured both at the beginning and at the end of the season for glacier mass balance figures. Sufficient information was collected to calculate a winter balance, summer balance and annual net balance. Different glacier margins were recognised, varying from snow aprons to calving cliffs. Based on a hypothesis that the type of margin may indicate the state of balance of the glacier, flow and strain rates and ablation measurements were made on some glaciers. Photo-theodolite photos were taken of several glaciers on a 1, 2, 5, 10 year basis for mapping and ice movement purposes. (Detailed mapping is beyond the scope of this equipment and in view of the small glacier fluctuations which occur here over lengthy time periods, these measurements will be of a qualitative rather than quantitative form.) Fixed benchmark photography of the glacier termini of several glaciers was completed. Ice cliff distance and height were measured on the Goodspeed, Hart, Meserve and Bartley Glaciers. In the 1980 81 season, where the Lower Wright Glacier enters Lake Brownworth, and the Taylor Glacier enters Lake Bonney, a number of ice samples were taken. Photos of ice crystals taken from samples will be studied to determine the position and formations present, where glacier ice meets the permanent lake ice. In the 1983 84 season, sites were installed and measurements taken to establish the cliff heights of points on the Lower Wright, Upper Wright, Clarke, Victoria, Meserve and Bartley Glacier margins. Sequences of glacier margin photographs taken from fixed points were repeated at the Lower Wright, Meserve and Heimdall Glaciers for comparison with previously taken sequences to determine glacier margin changes..

TITLE: Prevailing Mesosphere Wind Estimates (Meteor Winds) from the MAP WINE Experiment at Volgograd, USSR and Heiss Island (Arctic Ocean). ABSTRACT: This data set contains wind estimates for both the zonal and meridional components of prevailing winds recorded at Volgograd, USSR and Heiss Island (Arctic Ocean). The measurements were carried out under the MAP WINE Project using ground-based meteor radars. The derived prevailing wind is not climatological as it varies from day to day. The term 'meteor wind' is used for the mesosphere wind estimates derived from meteor trail drifts measurements. Ionized meteor trails are produced by meteoroids (meteor particles) which enter the Earth's atmosphere. A meteor trail moves in the atmosphere due to the neutral wind and magnetic field. The radial component of this movement is measured using meteor radar. Estimates of 'meteor wind' are derived for each direction (North, South, East, West) from the set of measurements of radial components using statistical characteristics of meteor parameter distributions and parameters of antenna pattern. Meteoroids occur in the height interval 80-100 km and are centered at 92-95 km (maximum for the apex time, near 6 a.m. LT, and minimum for anti-apex time, near 6 p.m. LT ). The MAP WINE (Middle Atmosphere Program Winter in Northern Europe) was one of the MAP projects scheduled for Fall-Winter 1983-1984. The aim was to coordinate observational studies of the high-latitude European middle atmosphere in winter, leading to an improved understanding of the winter variability structure, motions, and composition..

TITLE: SeaWiFS Level 3 Global Binned 9 KM Monthly Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km (approximately 81 km2). Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file. The parameters are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] More detailed information on the Level-3 binned data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_Binned_Data_Products.pdf The SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov SeaWiFS Binned .

TITLE: MMS Central Northern California Low-altitude birds and mammals. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Principal Investigator(s) Affiliation: Thomas P. Dohl, Center for Marine Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz.Marine Mammal and Seabird Surveys Of Central And Northern California Studies: -- Central Northern Calif - Low Aerial [Birds and Mammals] Study Code: CL Contract Number: 14-12-0001-29090 PURPOSE: To determine species composition, distribution, abundance, and seasonal variation for marine mammal and seabird populations, provide a description of habitat use, and identify areas of special biological importance to these populations in the central and northern California study area. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: February 1980 through June 1983 STUDY AREA: Shelf, slope, and offshore waters to a distance of 100 nm off the California coast from Point Conception to the California-Oregon boundary. METHODOLOGY: Offshore transect surveys were flown twice-monthly at two different altitudes (200 ft and about 750-1,000 ft ASL) along approximately 40 east-west transect lines extending an average of 60 nm offshore. The transects sampled on a given survey were selected randomly from a set of 92 standard (predetermined) lines spaced at intervals of 5' of latitude. Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, and sea otters were recorded only on low-altitude surveys. Sightings of cetaceans and turtles were recorded on both low- and high-altitude surveys. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor on both high- and low-altitude surveys, but only the shaded side of the aircraft was searched on the low-altitude surveys. Cross-legs connecting standard transects were searched only on high-altitude surveys. Offshore cross-legs were searched on both sides of the aircraft, while only the nearshore side was searched on cross-legs along the coast. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega. DATABASES PRODUCED: Three databases of sightings at sea were produced by these studies (data on numbers of seabirds and pinnipeds on land were also collected but are not addressed in the present study). These include 1) sightings of cetaceans and turtles recorded on 36 high-altitude aerial surveys, 2) sightings of cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea otters, and turtles recorded on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys, and 3) sightings of seabirds on 36 low-altitude aerial surveys. Each sighting database is accompanied by files providing the search effort on transect and environmental characteristics of the waters surveyed (e.g., sea surface temperature).

TITLE: Circumpolar Active-Layer Permafrost System (CAPS). ABSTRACT: The Circumpolar Active-Layer Permafrost System (CAPS) CD-ROM contains data sets and information products pertaining to permafrost and frozen ground topics. CAPS was originally compiled by the International Permafrost Association's (IPA) Standing Committee on Data Information and Communication (SCDIC)in 1998, and was updated by NSIDC and the IPA's SCDIC in 2003. CAPS contains over 100 data sets and information products pertaining to permafrost and frozen ground topics. It also contains detailed metadata records describing over 100 additional data sets available at other GGD nodes around the world. Dozens of contributors submitted data collections representing global sites. CAPS is organized for use within an HTML browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. Most data files are in ASCII text format, and in a few cases data are also provided in Microsoft Excel. Maps are typically available in the ESRI Shapefile GIS format. Some of the larger data files have been compressed with gzip. Images are in JPG, GIF, and PNG format. This compilation of data and information products is intended for a broad audience including the scientific and engineering communities, educators, and policy makers. The data published on CAPS is also available through NSIDC's Frozen Ground Data Center web site. The Frozen Ground Data Center holds the most current permafrost and frozen ground data and information. Permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, is ground (soil, sediment or rock) that remains at or below 0 degrees C for at least two years (Permafrost Subcommittee, 1988). It occurs both on land and beneath offshore arctic continental shelves, and underlies approximately 15% of the exposed land surface in the Northern Hemisphere. Permafrost thickness ranges from less than 1 m to greater than 1000 m..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Weekly Calcite Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html Coccolithophores are small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 9 KM Daily Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Canadian Base Network (CBN) of Monumented Survey Control. ABSTRACT: The Canadian Base Network (CBN) is a network of pillar monumented survey control points with forced-centering plates positioned three-dimensionally. They have GPS to centimetre-level accuracy with respect to the Canadian Active Control System (CACS). The CBN, once completed, will consist of an array of pillars at an average spacing of 200 km in the built-up areas of southern Canada, 500 km in the middle regions of Canada, and 1000 km in the northern regions of Canada. As well as being a GPS control network, the CBN can serve as a monitoring network for deformation studies of the Canadian landmass. The CBN is designed to serve as the new ground segment of monumented survey control in the Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS).

TITLE: Yakuta South Alaska Coastal Wildlife Surveys 2004-2005. ABSTRACT: This data set contains coastal survey data for summer and winter for the Yakutat, southern Alaska, region. It covers basic transects for marine wildlife, e.g. waterbirds, seabirds and sea mammals, along the coast. Data were collected with unlimited width surveys (index of relative abundance) from a jetboat (1.5m eye height) on both sides of the boat, throughout the years 2004-2005. In addition, encountered Marbled and Kittlitz's Murrelets were surveyed from one side of the boat with DISTANCE Sampling protocol to obtain compatability, e.g. densities corrected for detectability. This data set contributes to a coastal inventory of coastal wildlife of the U.S. Forest Service Yakutat region, and can be used to assess murrelet abundances in the Northern Pacific waters..

TITLE: Comprehensive Ocean - Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) LMRF Arctic Subset. ABSTRACT: The Comprehensive Ocean - Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) LMRF Arctic subset contains marine surface weather reports for the region north of 65 degrees N from ships, drifting ice stations, and buoys. COADS is the result of an ongoing project to assemble and reduce machine-readable portions of the available historical ocean-atmosphere record into a regular, compact, easy-to-use database. The COADS LMRF Arctic subset contains data collected over the years 1950 to 1995. The following parameters are included in this data set: air and sea temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and winds. The scientists assembling COADS have attempted to integrate all available digitized, directly sensed surface-marine data sets that would contribute information of reasonable quality. Most of the early data were gathered by ships-of-opportunity. More recent data also come from fixed research vessels, buoys, and other observing devices. Data archived at NSIDC is for the region North of 65 degrees N. for the years 1950-1995. Updates will be made available as they are received at NSIDC.

TITLE: LIDAR measurements for PSC studies at middle and high latitudes in southern hemisphere. ABSTRACT: Ozone depletion is one of the key issues on which the investigation of the international community is directed. Its great importance is due to the fact that ozone depletion results in an alteration of the chemical physical equilibrium of the atmosphere. Such alteration can induce variation in the climatology and then potential and real influences on the planetary ecosystem. The phenomenon of ozone depletion is much more evident in the polar stratospheres because of the very low temperatures existing there during the winter (particularly in Antarctica). The observations have established that the phenomenon is directly related to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). The PSCs, which can only form in the low polar temperatures, also produce the dehydration and the denitrification of the stratosphere by the sedimentation of their particles. The removal of water and nitrates increase the lifetime of the active chlorine improving the catalytic ozone depletion. Recently, observations of clouds at high tropospheric and low stratospheric altitudes have established the importance of cirrus clouds for their contribution to the ozone destruction at lower stratospheric levels. Our group possesses two LIDAR stations in Antarctica, one at the American base of McMurdo (MCM), and the second at the French base of Dumont d'Urville (DDU). Both the stations are LIDAR primary stations for the NDSC (Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change). The MCM and the DDU base are favorably placed for the study of the stratospheric phenomena connected to the polar vortex activity, the American base being well inside the polar vortex area and the French base in position such as to make possible measurements at the vortex edge. LIDAR systems operates with a Nd:YAG laser, the transmitter being equipped with a 532 nm channel, pulsed at 10 Hz repetition rate with pulse energy of 200 mJ about. By LIDAR observation retrievals we measure PSC microphysics characteristics, aerosol extinction in the 8-35 km range and the temperature profile in the 30-60 km range, in absence of PSC and aerosol. The LIDAR stations operate continuously since 1993 (MCM) and 1989 (DDU)..

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Cumulative Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: Real-time and Historical Marine Meteorological and Oceanographic Data from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). ABSTRACT: NOAA's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) offers real-time and historical data from its moored buoys, drifting buoy data, and C-MAN (Coastal-Marine Automated Network)stations. Data are transmitted hourly via the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and commercial satellites. Some data are transmitted half hourly. NDBC also functions as a Data Assembly Center (DAC) for the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). As the U.S. DAC, NDBC receives, quality controls, and distributes data from numerous data contributors. Most stations measure wind speed and direction, wind gust, barometric pressure and air temperature. All buoys and some C-MAN stations measure sea surface temperature, wave height, and wave period. Monthly and annual climatic summary tables are available. Stations are located throughout U.S. coastal waters including U.S. Atlantic coast, U.S. Pacific coast, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes and Hawaiian Islands. Some stations are also located in the western equatorial Pacific. Real-time data are available hourly (for at least the last 24 hours) in tabular form. After several days, data is quality-controlled and appended to daily data files. Archives of monthly and annual data may also be accessed, except for some non-NDBC stations. The following types of quality-controlled data are available: standard meteorological data, continuous winds data, spectral wave density data, spectral wave direction data, water level data, ocean current profile data,and ocean surface current data. Data are available through NDBC's WWW server using the station locator map or the station ID list and search: http:  www.ndbc.noaa.gov stations.shtml Data are available by RSS: see http:  www.ndbc.noaa.gov rss_access.shtml Dial-A-Buoy phone number: 888-701-8992 Email data service is available: see http:  www.ndbc.noaa.gov email_access.shtml FTP service is also available: ftp:  tgftp.nws.noaa.gov Anonymous FTP: http:  seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov and give email address as the password cd data observations marine  [This summary updated November, 2007.].

TITLE: Year-round Urban Raven Surveys in Fairbanks, Interior Alaska 2004-2006. ABSTRACT: This dataset presents Raven (Corvus corax) survey data carried out for over two years at a supermarket parking lot (app. 300m*600m), strip mall, in Fairbanks, interior Alaska app. 120 miles south of the arctic circle. Data were collected bi-weekly, or with a higher frequency, on Sundays or Saturdays between 8 AM and 11 AM by driving on the parking lot for 15 minutes; detectability is believed to be 100 %. This results into unbiased surveys providing a snap shot in time. Other opportunistic surveys were included as well, e.g. collected during the week or from locations nearby. The parking lot represents a typical situation of Ravens in an urban habitat. Ravens were scanned for bands and marks, but none were found. Moult and age were also noted. Basic Raven behaviour is also reported, as well as state of the parking lot in regards to parked trucks and cars, food items, garbage, fast food left-overs, snow and climate. All other bird species were recorded as well, e.g. common gulls (Larus canus) in summer (almost no other species were seen). Bird abundance seems to be driven by food items on the parking lot, e.g. provided by an adjacent fast food restaurant and by left-overs from parties at the parking lot from the previous night. The numbers of Ravens at this study site are relatively small (app. 15 birds in winter and none in summer) and consistent patterns are shown. It is believed that the described situation applies to many other supermarket parking lots in the vicinity as well. It is suggested that these 2 years of data are unique and represent baseline information relevant for Ravens in the interior of Alaska; they are a simple but powerful snapshot in time and when put into an overall ecological context. Provides basic information on Raven abundance, behaviour and related information in a quantitative fashion for interior Alaska..

TITLE: Modern and fossil ostracode census data from the Western Pacific Ocean and seas around Japan. ABSTRACT: This data set is part of the Pliocene Research, Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) Project. Data or information about the data set can be obtained online via the World Wide Web at: URL> "http:  geochange.er.usgs.gov pub PRISM ostracodes pacific " or ftp: ftp> geochange.er.usgs.gov in  pub PRISM ostracodes "ftp:  geochange.er.usgs.gov pub PRISM ostracodes" The following information about the data set was provided by the data center contact: This data set describes marine ostracode species and related sample and stratigraphic information produced as part of the USGS PRISM Project (Pliocene Research, Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping). The general goals of PRISM are to reconstruct global climate during a period of extreme warmth about 3 million years ago and to determine the causes of the warmth and the subsequent climatic change towards colder climates about 2.5 million years ago. To do this, PRISM has been studying Pliocene deposits and their microfaunas and, by comparison with modern assemblages, estimating past boundary conditions such as ocean temperatures. To obtain more reliable estimates of past environments in paleoclimate studies, the use of ecologically sensitive species requires extensive modern datasets on living species with limited environmental tolerances. Thus, much of the data generated by PRISM consists of species counts from modern samples that form a "coretop" dataset applicable not only to PRISM Pliocene assemblages but also to Quaternary assemblages as well. This situation was especially true for ostracodes, a group of Crustacea that includes many species that have limited range of water temperatures required for survival, reproduction, or both. Fossil assemblages of ostracodes can therefore yield information on past bottom water conditions on continental shelves in the mixed ocean layer above the thermocline and they are especially useful where planktic foraminifers are rare or absent. However comprehensive datasets with quantitative ostracode data were not available for application to regional paleoceanographic studies. Further, because of the endemic nature of ostracodes living on continental shelves, separate modern datasets needed to be developed for regions of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The data contained in the files in this folder come from the western North Pacific Ocean, mainly the seas around Japan. These regions encompass subtropical to cold temperate and subfrigid marine climate zones and include faunas from the major Western North Pacific water masses such as the Oyashio and Kuroshio current systems. The ostracode data sets were developed in collaboration with Prof. Noriyuki Ikeya, Institute of Geosciences, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan, Prof. Ikeya's students, and other Japanese colleagues, with support from the USGS Global Change and Climate History Program and grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF grant INT: LTV-9013402) and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS grant EPAR- 093). Most of the faunal slides are housed at Shizuoka University. Separate PRISM ostracode data sets contain modern and Pliocene species data from continental shelves of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans and from deep sea environments. Among the various types of quantitative analyses used to evaluate the ostracode data, the Squared Chord Distance (SCD) coefficient of dissimilarity was found to be useful in identifying modern analog assemblages for fossil assemblages on the basis of the proportions of shared species between two samples. The ostracode data and analyses of them are discussed in detail in the following published scientific papers: Ikeya, Noriyuki and Cronin, Thomas.

TITLE: Marine mammals exploring the oceans pole to pole. ABSTRACT: Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole (MEOP) will deploy state-of-the-art animal-borne CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) tags on strategically chosen, deep-diving marine mammal species to explore their current movement patterns, behaviour and habitat utilization in Polar Regions. Deployments will take place on the deepest diving seals in the Arctic and Antarctic – hooded seals in the north and elephant seals in the south. Additionally, to maximise ice-filled water coverage, deployments will also take place on Weddell seals and crabeater seals. Concomitant with the sampling of ecological data sets on these top predators, the animals will themselves (via the equipment they carry) collect a vast, high-precision oceanographic data set from logistically difficult areas of ocean in Polar Seas at the fringes of the North and South Atlantic and the South Pacific that are strategically important to climate and ocean modelling. Co-operation between programmes within IPY will provide MEOP with comprehensive, synoptic oceanographic coverage that will allow us, for the first time ever at this level, to quantify factors determining habitat selection by key polar marine mammal species. In turn, our ocean data sets will contribute significantly to modelling ocean circulation patterns and serve as input to advanced climate models.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Mapped 4 KM Daily Fluorescence Line Height Data. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of global ocean Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The fluorescence line height product (parameter 2575) is part of the chlorophyll fluorescence product group (MODIS Product 20). Although fluorescence has been used for decades to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, our eventual focus will be on its use in estimating primary productivity. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 fluorescence line height products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. The fluorescence line height algorithm is a relative measure of the amount of radiance leaving the sea surface, which is presumably a result of chlorophyll fluorescence. By constructing a baseline using bands on either side of the fluorescence band, we can estimate the deviation from the amount of radiance expected for pure water that results from chlorophyll fluorescence. This increase in radiance (centered at 683 nm for chlorophyll) has been noted for decades in measurements of the light field in the ocean. This signal is generally weak, even in regions of high chlorophyll concentrations. To measure fluorescence, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was increased for the fluorescence band and the adjacent baseline bands at 665.1 nm (band 13) and 746.3 nm (band 15). The fluorescence measurement itself is made at 676.7 nm (band 14) as a compromise between measuring the fluorescence peak (683 nm) and the presence of an oxygen absorption band at 687 nm.

TITLE: Arctic Sea Ice Melt Pond Statistics and Maps, 1999, 2000, and 2001. ABSTRACT: Visible band imagery from high-resolution satellites were acquired over four Arctic Ocean sites (three in 1999) during the summers of 1999, 2000, and 2001. The sites were within the median extent of the perennial ice pack. Imagery was analyzed using supervised maximum likelihood classification to derive either two (water and ice) or three (pond, open water, and ice) surface classes. Clouds were masked by hand. The data set consists of tables of pond coverage and size statistics for 500 m square cells within 10 km square images (image resolution is 1 meter), along with the surface type maps called Image Derived Products (IDPs) from which the pond statistics were derived. A total of 101 images over the three summers and four sites were used for pond statistics, out of a total of 1056 images acquired. The images are irregularly spaced in time. Data are stored in MIcrosoft Excel format and ASCII text, image files are stored as GeoTIFF binary images, browse images in PNG, and JPG image files, and are available from August 1999 and generally for May into September for 2000 and 2001 via FTP..

TITLE: Marine Surface Observations-FNWC Automatic Digital Information Network (AUTODIN) Synoptic (DSI-1145). ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The Fleet Numerical Weather Center (FNWC) in Monterey, California since 1982 is producing a global data set from the Automatic Digital Information Network (AUTODIN). These data are hourly observations from global ship observations. Parameters included in the hourly observations are the following: Air, sea, and dew point temperature; cloud cover; humidity; pressure; winds; weather; surface currents; sea surface heights; waves; swell; and sea ice. Information on the AUTODIN ship data tapes is written on 9-track tape at 1600CPI. Each line of information contains 80 characters, with blank fill to the right of the last non-blank character. Each record on the tape contains from one to 20 such lines. Thus the length of any record will be 80 n characters where n is more than 1 and less than 20. (Maximum record length is 1600 characters.) Information from each AUTODIN data cut is blocked as follows: a. All except the last record for this data cut will contain 20 lines (1600 characters). b. The last record for the cut will contain from one to 20 lines. All of the information on the tape is contained in one file (An end-of-file is NOT used to separate data cuts). There are two consecutive ends of file at the end of information. As of 05 January 1982, there will be eight cuts per day, at hours 02Z, 03Z,08Z, 09Z, 14Z, 15Z, 20Z, and 21z. Cut-times and dates which appear in the first line of information for each cut may be used as a key to check for missing data. However, the number of cuts per day might be changed in the future, so any computer program which checks these cut-times should be designed to allow more and or different cut hours. A missing cut-time will not always indicate missing reports; in rare situations, machine problems may cause one cut to be missed, but the AUTODIN input tape for the cut might be loaded on a later cut. PURPOSE: To make a wide range of climatic data available to researchers and the public. CURRENTNESS REFERENCE: Ground Condition.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 1B Data Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color and SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances generated from Level 1A sensor counts and GEO files. Additional data are provided, including quality flags, error estimates, and calibration data. There are differences between the Level 1B produced and distributed by OBPG and the Standard Level 1B files (MYD021KM, MYD02HKM, MYD02QKM) produced by MODIS Calibration Support Team (MCST). This is because OBPG uses the Ocean subsetted Level 1A products as input to the Level 1B processing. The Ocean subsetted products contain only those bands that are used for Ocean product generation. The standard Level-1B processing code (MYD_PR02) is developed and maintained by the MODIS Calibration Support Team (MCST). The OBPG uses a slightly modified version of MYD_PR02 to handle subsetted Level-1A. Information about the OBPG MODIS Level-1B products can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov PRODUCTS Level_1B.html Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 1 data at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi browse.pl?sen=am Aqua MODIS Level 1B daytime data for the most-recent days can be downloaded by FTP at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Recent_Day  Aqua MODIS Level 1B nighttime data for the most-recent days can be downloaded by FTP at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Recent_Night .

TITLE: Eastern Colorado Palmer Drought Severity Index Reconstruction, NOAA NGDC WDC Paleoclimatology. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of Eastern Colorado May June July Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) Reconstruction based on tree ring chronologies in the western Great Plains and Front Range. [Abstract] A sustained mid-19th century drought in the western Great Plains has been indicated by a tree-ring analysis of trees flanking the western Great Plains, and in tree-ring reconstructions of drought and streamflow for eastern Colorado and the Colorado Front Range. The development of new tree-ring chronologies for the western Great Plains, in combination with existing chronologies, now enables a more detailed assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics of this drought. The analysis of a set of drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies ranging from the northwestern Great Plains to central New Mexico indicates a core area of drought from south-central Wyoming to northeastern New Mexico for the years 1845-56. Drought was particularly severe in the years 1845-48, 1851, and 1854-56, contracting and affecting smaller regions in intervening years. The impact of this drought on natural ecosystems and human activities is difficult to gauge because of the paucity of historical documents and the confounding effects of land use changes occurring over the same period. However, it is probable that this drought played a role in the decimation of bison herds in the second half of the 19th century. Were it to occur today, this relatively small but persistent drought would have significant impacts on the Colorado Front Range metropolitan area and the agricultural regions of eastern Colorado..

TITLE: Evaluation of the suitability of conservationally acceptable materials for treating wood in the polar environment to reduce wood deterioration.. ABSTRACT: In the 1998-1999 season, three test racks with wood panels were erected near the three historic huts at Hut Point, Cape Evans and Cape Royds. The racks were placed outside the historic hut boundaries but in exposed sites. The panels contained blocks of wood measuring 100mm x 150mm x 50mm in size. There were two types of wood used for each block, Pinus radiata and Baltic pine. The blocks of wood were treated with several different materials including 4 silicon based products, paint and a control. The racks were examined every two years and one set of samples was removed every three years to test the ability of the treatment to prevent non-biological damage to the wood and therefore determine which material is best suited to withstand the environmental conditions. The wood blocks were taken to the University of Minnesota for examination..

TITLE: Marine Sediment Geochemistry Data (Pore Water). ABSTRACT: This dataset consists of analyses for dissolved sulfate and ammonium done on pore water samples extracted from sediment cores. In addition, most of the sediment samples have been analyzed for organic carbon content of the dry sediment. The sediment cores were collected during research cruises conducted by, or for, the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic) at more than 35 field study locations around the world.The data are used to determine the change in concentration with depth (concentration gradient) in the core for sulfate and ammonium. From this concentration gradient, an empirical relationship is used to estimate organic carbon burial at that location.

TITLE: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat 7). ABSTRACT: Abstract: This data set is a raster file containing global information for bands 1 through 8 for Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat 7 ETM+). Purpose: The mission of the Landsat-7 satellite is to provide a vehicle for continuing the flow of global change information to users worldwide. The Landsat-7 satellite fulfills its mission by providing repetitive, synoptic coverage of continental surfaces and by collecting data in spectral bands that include the visible, near-infrared, shortwave, and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Landsat-7 mission objectives include: 1) Maintaining Landsat data continuity by providing data that are consistent in terms of data acquisition, geometry, spatial resolution, calibration, coverage characteristics, and spectral characteristics with previous Landsat data. 2) Generating and periodically refreshing a global archive of substantially cloud-free, Sun-lit, land-mass imagery. 3) Continuing to make remote sensing satellite data available to domestic and international users and expanding the use of such data for global change research in both the Government and private commercial sectors. 4) Promoting interdisciplinary research via synergism with other EOS observations, specifically, orbiting in tandem with the EOS Terra satellite for near coincident observations. Supplemental_Information: The Landsat-7 system is another step in the development and application of remotely sensed satellite data for use in managing the Earth's land resources. As with earlier Landsat systems, the Landsat-7 platform, along with its enhanced thematic mapping sensor, provides for new capabilities in the remote sensing of Earth's land surface. Landsat-7 data are collected from a nominal altitude of 705 kilometers in a near-polar, near-circular, Sun-synchronous orbit at an inclination of 98.2 degrees, imaging the same 183-km swath of Earth's surface every 16 days. Some of the browse images you encounter may appear black or empty. These are engineering data known as Full Aperture Calibrator (FAC) data. The FAC is a white painted panel that is deployed in front of the ETM+ aperture and diffusely reflects solar radiation into the full aperture of the instrument. The FAC scenes are typically gathered on a monthly basis and constitute roughly 5 to 7 scenes for each FAC collected. Eventually these engineering data will be gleaned out of the database. Depending on the time of year, the solar azimuth angle with respect to the velocity vector of the ETM+ sensor, varies from 23 degrees to 37 degrees. This is the only area where FAC data will be collected.

Responsibility for construction of the spacecraft and instrument lies with NASA. The Landsat Program is part of NASA's Earth Observing System global change initiative administered by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise. Data processing, archiving, and distribution are performed by the USGS. The primary ground station, the data handling facility and archive are located at the USGS EROS Center in Sioux Falls, SD. NASA managed flight operations from the control center at the Goddard Space Flight Center until October 1, 2000, at which time responsibility for flight operations transferred to the USGS.

TITLE: NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratories Bering and Chukchi Sea Ice Drift. ABSTRACT: Four ARGOS ice buoys were deployed in March 1981 (monitored 3 6 to 3 14), and six buoys in January 1982 (maximum period monitored: 1 26 to 6 30) to measure ice movement within the pack ice in the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea. Plots of buoy floe trajectories are published in Macklin (1984) and Reynolds (1984). These data were collected as part of Bering Air-Sea-Ice Study (BASICS) experiments studying "physical oceanographic, meteorological and other physical quantities which determine the structure, position and rate-of-advance of the marginal ice zone of the seasonal Bering Sea ice pack and the feedback of ice conditions to the surrounding environment" (Macklin 1984). In 1985, 15 ARGOS buoys were deployed in the Bering Sea as part of the Arctic Polynya Experiment (APEX). Monitoring period was approximately February to June. From 1987 to 1989 Bering Sea buoy data are also archived (1987: 11 buoys, pressure, temperature, and position, deployments in March, September, November; 1988: three buoys, pressure, temperature, position, deployments in October; 1989 deployment history unknown at present).

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Seasonal Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS SST products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). The generation of SST products from the MODIS sensors is performed using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 software (MSl12), based on algorithms and logic originally developed by the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmosphere Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami. Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS modis_sst  The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is a 16-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. Each SMI product contains one geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Three SMI products are generated for each standard SST binning period: NSST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (nighttime) SST = Sea Surface Temperature - 11 micron (daytime) SST4 = Sea Surface Temperature - 4 micron (nighttime only) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.

TITLE: Induction magnetometer data, Arrival heights, Scott Base, Antarctica. ABSTRACT: A magnetometer and data recording system was installed and began recording hydromagnetic and ion cyclotron waves (geomagnetic pulsations) propagating into the high latitude cusp and polar cap regions of the earth's magnetic field in January 1989 at Arrival Heights, Ross Island, Antarctica. The data represent two horizontal components of the Earth magnetic field variations dB dt. The magnetometer continuously records data throughout the year and operates in conjunction with the Australian network of similar magnetometers at Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island stations. The magnetometer consists of two induction coil sensors aligned along magnetic North-South and East-West and buried some distance from the Arrival Heights Laboratory of Scott Base. The magnetometer was calibrated and maintained annually with necessary upgrades and modification. In January 2007, the magnetometer sensors and recording equipment was relocated to a new hut. Besides visible light, the sun radiates a super-sonic stream of charged particles (solar wind made up of protons and electrons). The solar winds, embedded in an interplanetary magnetic field, interact with the earth’s magnetic field, shaping it into a cavity called the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is shaped in such a way that the large interface area between the solar wind and the earth’s environment is focussed along the field lines onto a relatively small region of the high latitude atmosphere, over the polar zones. Waves (energetic particles and magnetic field disturbances) are generated through these interactions and are propagated through the ionosphere to the ground along magnetic field lines where they are recorded as pulsations of the geomagnetic field measured on the ground by magnetometers. Analysis of the frequency and nature of these measured ultra low frequency space plasma waves can indicated the source region. Besides being a fundamental study of plasma physics research, these effects also are frequently referred to as Space Weather events and may adversely affect operation of both satellite-based and ground communication, surveillance and navigation systems..

TITLE: Predictive Model of Migratory Shorebird Resting Sites: Great Knot, Red Knot and Bar-tailed Godwit in Coastal Sea of Okhotsk, Russian Far East. ABSTRACT: So far, the migration patterns of shorebirds in the Sea Of Okhotsk region, Russian Far East, have only been sketchily documented by Western sources. This is mostly due to the lack of international effort and due to the relative short amount of time that Russia has been open to Westerners (e.g. Huettmann 2003, unpublished). Most of our knowledge stems from only a few study sites in this large ecosystem. The need arose for naturalists, conservationists, researchers, and other interested parties to develop accurate but predictive models of migration resting sites and subsequently inferred migration routes between Australasia, far eastern Russia and the Arctic instead of using the broadly localized knowledge of years past. Here a first predictive model is presented for Great Knot (Calidris tenuirostris), Red Knot (C. canutus) and Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica) resting sites during fall and spring migration. This model is based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in S-PLUS and uses the best known information of shorebird resting sites from a Literature Review on this subject (Huettmann 2003). Habitat information was taken from GIS layers, software, digital and hardcopy maps. From the species models using compiled locations with known shorebird migration, it appears that the studied bird species in prefer tidal saltwater locations with organic matter and freshwater inflow. The models show spatial differences between spring and fall migration, which indicates different migration strategies. Further and continous ground-truthing is highly suggested. This model provides an additional view on shorebird migration, and it represents the first generation of predictive modeling for shorebirds in this large region. It is hoped that further fine-tuning and improvement of models and data will increase the accuracy of these models and of our knowledge on shorebird migration. This GIS dataset is based on a basic model used to determine possible resting sites in the Okhotsk region for three species of shorebirds: Great Knot (Calidris tenuirostris), Red Knot (Calidris canutus), and Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica). It uses accounts of previous resting locations reported from scientific expeditions and reports, compiled in a Literature Reviewand as digital GIS data (Huettmann 2003). By obtaining data on the reported confirmed locations of these shorebirds during spring and autumn migrations and then predicting them to locations with known habitat configurations, the relative probability of occurrence for species at these other resting sites can be determined. Further research can then be done at identified candidate locations allowing to infer on migration strategies, flyways and for carrying out an effective conservation management of habitats and species..

TITLE: Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA) Data Sets. ABSTRACT: PARCA began in 1993 with the primary goal of measuring and understanding the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Approximately 25 investigations used in situ measurements and satellite and aircraft remote sensing to study this issue. Measurements include surface elevation and ice thickness change rates from aircraft laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening thinning rates, and climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface albedo from microwave and AVHRR data.

TITLE: Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) McMurdo Dry Valleys Meteorological Station Measurements. ABSTRACT: [From "http:  huey.colorado.edu LTER meteordata.html"] Local meteorology drives and shapes all ecological systems. One of the first objectives of the McMurdo LTER was to establish a meteorological network that would gather representative weather data year-round from the dry valleys. The McMurdo LTER Automatic Weather Network (LAWN) currently consists of 13 stations Stations are now operational at Explorer's Cove, in Beacon Valley and on the shores of Lakes Fryxell, Hoare, Bonney, Brownworth, Vanda, and Vida and on the Commonwealth, Howard, and Taylor glaciers. Stations routinely sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (averages, maximums, etc.) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes.

TITLE: ANWR and Alaska Peninsula Gravity Data. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The gravity station data (1252 records) were compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey and the State of Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. This data base was received in August, 1984. Principal gravity parameters include Free-air Anomalies and Simple Bouguer Anomalies (no terrain correction applied) for the Alaska Peninsula. The observed gravity values are referenced to the International Gravity Standardization Net 1971 (IGSN 71). The gravity anomaly computation uses the Geodetic Reference System 1967 (GRS 67) theoretical gravity formula. The data are randomly distributed within the boundaries of northeast Alaska including the Arctic National Wildlife Range (ANWR) and the Alaska Peninsula. Note that the original USGS Open File Report by D. F. Barnes mentions the use of the 1931 International Ellipsoid for gravity reduction but this is believed to have subsequently been changed to the GRS 67 system. PURPOSE: To provide easy access to global and regional gravity data and related models for scientific studies.

TITLE: ERS-1 and ERS-2 SAR Data over Canada. ABSTRACT: The European Space Agency ERS-1 satellite was launched on July 17, 1991 with a projected lifespan of two to three years. CCRS began reception of its successor, ERS-2, on July 9, 1995 and is still receiving. Canada is a full participant in the ERS-1 program and is part of the ESA network of receiving and processing stations. This data set contains SAR high-resolution imagery, acquired by the ERS-1 Active Microwave Instrument (AMI). The scenes, for both ERS-1 and ERS-2, are 100 km in width, and are imaged by a 10 m long x 1 m wide antenna aligned parallel with the satellite orbit. The radar operates at a frequency of 5.3 GHz (C-Band), VV polarisation, and has a mid-swath incidence angle of 23 deg. in normal operation. However, the satellite has a 'roll tilt' capability which makes it possible to operate at 35 deg. incidence angle on an experimental basis. Power considerations limit operating times to a maximum of 12 minutes per orbit. The data rate of 105 Mbit s is too high to allow on-board storage, and so images are only acquired within the reception zones of the ground stations. Raw SAR data is processed in the SAR Data Processing Facility (SARDPF) located at the Gatineau ground receiving station. Standard products available are: Georeferenced Fine-Resolution (SGF), Systematically Geocoded (SSG), Precision Geocoded (SPG) with or without DTM, and Georeferenced Coarse-Resolution (SGC). Non standard products are Raw Data, Single Look Complex (SLC), Single Look Detected (SLD), and Multi Look Detected (MLD). Products are available on CCT (1600 bpi or 6250 bpi), Exabyte, transparency (B W) 185 mm, and transparency and prints. Access is on request, with a charge for the data. Data procurement selection criteria is by Lat Long coordinates or NTS Map Sheet. ERS-1 mosaics of Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland are available for downloading through GeoGratis free of charge and are subject to copyright restrictions and disclaimer. Please consult the section 'Earth Observation Imagery' at http:  geogratis.cgdi.gc.ca for additional information.This data is used primarily for natural resources management and provides excellent educational material.

TITLE: Standard CODAR Real-Time Archive Data. ABSTRACT: CODAR is used to measure the surface currents of the coastal ocean. A transmitter sends out a radio frequency that bounces off the ocean surface and back to areceiver antenna. Using this information and the principles of the Doppler shift, CODAR is able to calculate the speed and direction of the surface current. These calculations are made at about every half mile across the surface and extend as far as about twenty miles offshore. CODAR Archived Data for Standard and Long-range CODAR System is available online for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003..

TITLE: Dissolved Mn in the Southern Ocean. ABSTRACT: Sampling and Analytical Methodology: Samples were taken using 24 internally Teflon-coated PVC 12 litre GO-FLO Samplers (General Oceanics Inc.) mounted on an all-titanium frame (De Baar et al., 2008). This frame was connected to a 17.7 mm diameter Kevlar hydrowire with seven independent internal signal conductor cables (Cousin Trestec S.A.) and controlled from onboard. Each GO-FLO sampler had a special ultraclean all-teflon PTFE valve (Cole Parmer; PN A-06392-31) installed. Samples for trace metal analysis were collected from the GO-FLO bottles in a class 100 clean room environment. The water was filtered over a 0.2 μm filter cartridge (Sartrobran-300, Sartorius) under pressure (1.5 atm) of (in-line prefiltered) nitrogen gas exerted via a special connector instead of the regular air bleeding valve at the top of each GO-FLO sampler. Sub-samples for Mn were taken in cleaned LDPE sample bottles (125 mL) from each GO-FLO bottle. All sample bottles were rinsed five times with the sample seawater. Analyses of dissolved Manganese (Mn) were performed on shipboard with the method developed by Doi et al. (2004) with some slight modifications in the preparation and brands of the chemicals used. Furthermore, samples were buffered in-line with an ammonium borate sample buffer (see text below). Samples were acidified with 12 M ultraclean HCl (Baseline® Hydrochloric Acid, Seastar Chemicals Inc.) to a pH of 1.8 and stored inside double plastic bags in plastic crates. At the home institute, in a flow injection system, the samples were buffered in-line to a pH of 8.5 ± 0.2 with ammonium borate sample buffer. This buffer was produced by dissolving 30.9 grams of boric acid (Suprapure, Merck) in 1 L MQ water and adjusting the pH to 9.4 with ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure, Merck). Dissolved Mn in the buffered sample was preconcentrated for 200 seconds on a Toyopearl AFChelate 650M (TesoHaas, Germany) column. Hereafter the column was rinsed for 60 seconds with MQ water to remove interfering salts. The Mn was subsequently eluted from the column for 200 seconds with a solution of 0.1M three times quartz distilled formic acid (reagent grade, Merck) containing 0.1 M hydrogen peroxide (Suprapure, Merck) and 12 mM ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure, Merck). The pH of this carrier solution was adjusted to 2.9 ± 0.05. The eluate with the dissolved Mn passed a second column of immobilized 8-hydroxyquinoline (Landing et al., 1986) to remove interfering iron ions in the carrier solution (Doi et al., 2004). Hereafter the carrier mixed subsequently with 0.7 M ammonium hydroxide (Suprapure Merck) and a luminol solution. The latter luminol solution was made by diluting 600 μl luminol stock solution and 10 μl TETA (triethylenetetramine, Merck) in 1 L MQ. The luminol stock solution was made by diluting 270 mg luminol (3-aminophtalhydrazide, Aldrich) and 500 mg potassium carbonate in 15 ml MQ. The resulting mixture of carrier solution, ammonium hydroxide and luminol solution had a pH of 10.2 ± 0.05 and entered a 3 meter length mixing coil placed in a water bath of 25°C. Hereafter the chemiluminescence was detected with a Hamamatsu HC135 Photon counter. Concentrations of dissolved Mn were calculated in nanomol•L-1 (nM) from the photon emission peak height (see below). The system was calibrated using standard additions from a 5000 nM Mn stock solution (Fluka) to filtered acidified seawater of low Mn concentration that was collected in Antarctic Ocean. A five-points calibration line (0, 0.15, 0.36, 0.73 and 1.46 nM standard additions) and blank determination were made daily. The three lowest points (0, 0.15 and 0.36 nM) of the calibration line were measured in triplicate and the two highest points (0.73 and 1.46 nM) in duplicate to add more weight to the lower part of the calibration line. The blank was determined by measuring column-cleaned seawater. Latter was obtained by passing seawater over a Toyopearl AFChelate 650M and an 8-hydroxyquinoline column which retained the dissolved Mn. The average blank value was 20 pM. The limit of detection defined as three times the standard deviation of the blank was < 0.01 nM. The flow injection system was rinsed every day with a 0.5 M HCl solution. Data Processing: The system was calibrated using standard additions from a 5000 nM Mn stock solution (Fluka) to filtered acidified seawater of low Mn concentration that was collected in Antarctic Ocean. A five-points calibration line (0, 0.15, 0.36, 0.73 and 1.46 nM standard additions) and blank determination were made daily. The three lowest points (0, 0.15 and 0.36 nM) of the calibration line were measured in triplicate and the two highest points (0.73 and 1.46 nM) in duplicate to add more weight to the lower part of the calibration line. The blank was determined by measuring column-cleaned seawater. Latter was obtained by passing seawater over a Toyopearl AFChelate 650M and an 8-hydroxyquinoline column which retained the dissolved Mn. The average blank value was 20 pM. The limit of detection defined as three times the standard deviation of the blank was < 0.01 nM. The flow injection system was rinsed every day with a 0.5 M HCl solution. A standard was measured in triplicate every day. This standard was a sub-sample of a 25 L volume of filtered seawater that was taken at the beginning of the cruise. This standard was analysed 40 times on different days and the relative standard deviation of the replicate analysis in triplicate was 3.2%. The relative standard deviation on the separate days was on average 1.3 %. The average concentration of Mn of this standard was 0.44 nM and the deviation from this average for a given measuring day was used as a correction factor. To verify whether this correction was decreasing the inter-daily variability in the dataset, every day a sample which was collected and measured the previous measuring day, was analysed once again. The deviation between the concentrations measured on the different days decreased from 3.5% to 2.5%, indicating the data correction procedure is beneficial. As an independent comparison, the certification samples collected on the SAFe cruise (Johnson et al., 2007) were analysed for Mn. As an independent comparison, the certification samples collected on the American SAFe cruise (Johnson et al., 2007) were analysed in triplicate for Mn. The resulting concentrations of Mn for both SAFe Surface (S) and SAFe deep (D2) from 1000 m, agreed very nicely the community consensus value that is starting to emerge on the absolute concentrations of Mn in the SAFe samples. The dataset was scanned for obvious outliers and these have been quality flagged with the number 4. Some samples gave anomalous nutrient results for the intended depth and were assumed to have been closed at the wrong depth and quality flagged with the number 8. All other values are assumed to be correct and flagged with the number 0..

TITLE: LANDSAT MSS System Corrected, absolute and statistical correction (SCAS) Product. ABSTRACT: Most of the ESA archive has been acquired and processed at receiving stations in Fucino (Italy), Kiruna (Sweden) and Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain). However, the archive contains also a substantial number of data acquired and processed by receiving stations elsewhere (e.g. the US, Brasil, Canada, ect.). The system corrected data contains MSS data radiometrically and geometrically corrected relative to the four MSS spectral bands covering on full WRS scene. Radiometric and geometric corrections are applied in sequence and the quality standards are expressed by combined radiometric and geometric corrected data quality standards. RADIOMETRIC CORRECTIONS Each pixel's radiometric value is processed through a look-up table, generated with one of the following methods: * Relative radiometric corrections method (statistical): this method performs the statistical equalisation for the different detectors of the same band. * Absolute in flight radiometric calibration: this method utilizes the on-board calibration wedge data to determine the absolute radiometric calibration gains and offsets. * Relative and absolute radiometric calibration method: this process is a combination of the above methods. GEOMETRIC CORRECTIONS The MSS geometric corrections are based on the generation of three geometric correction tables which group the different geometric error sources and model: * the along scan correction table (panoramic distorsion, Earthcurvature, satellite altitude and attitude, etc.) * scan skew offset table * between line distance table whichaccounts for the nadir velocity,variation of the S C pitch angle, S C altitude. Landsat full scene of imagery data correspond to an effective ground coverage area of approximately 185 km wide by 185 km in along-track direction for Landsat 1, 2, 3 and 185 x 170 for Landsat 4 and 5. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection between a path and row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 20 km). For a floating full scene the placement along the path is chosen by the customer. The centre point of the floating full scene is defined by the path number and the required latitude. A full image is composed of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each band requires 40 Mbytes of storage space. To order data please see http:  earth.esa.int helpandmail help_order.html.

TITLE: Paleoglaciology of Alaska. ABSTRACT: The Paleoglaciology of Alaska project involves scientists to estimate past climate parameters from glacial-geologic records. This project combines field research and cosmogenic-surface-exposure dating with GIS analysis of Alaskan glaciers that existed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). -Former glacier extents, coupled with high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM's), permit us to quantify past Equilibrium Line Altitudes (paleo-ELA's). -For each glacier, this parameter records a balance between winter precipitation and summer temperature. -Dense spatial arrays of hundreds of paleoELA's within 8 broad mountainous regions clarify: microclimatic vs. regional climatic controls on glacier growth; synoptic views of atmospheric moisture circulation; and spatially varying LGM aridity for comparison with numerical climate simulations.

TITLE: SAR images from ERS, JERS and RADARSAT processed at Tromso Satellite Station since 1993. ABSTRACT: Tromso Satellite Station is equipped with one of the world's fastest processing and distribution system for ERS-1 SAR data. The ERS-1 SAR processor is based on a parallel processing concept and is developed and produced in Norway. A similar, but not as powerful, processor is used for JERS-1 SAR processing on a contract with ESA. The Norwegian developed broad band distribution system, NORSAT-B (2 Mb s), gives TSS a unique and flexible distribution capacity for full resolution SAR images. TSS offers a SAR full resolution image, a SAR low resolution image, and a SAR low resolution calibrated image from the ERS-1 SAR sensor. These images cover areas of 100x100 km and are produced within 8 minutes after acquisition. In agreement with ESA NASDA the same products based on the JERS-1 SAR sensor will be offered. The JERS-1 products cover an area of 75x75 km and are available approx. 20 minutes after data acquisition. Through the Norwegian national ERS-1 programme, the ERS-1 SAR data has been demonstrated to be most useful for several near real-time applications: * ice monitoring * ship detection * oil spill detection * weather and wave forecast * autumn ploughing TSS will continue the operations on the ERS-2 satellite when data from that satellite becomes available during Spring 1995. All ERS-1 SAR images processed are available for ordering from archive..

TITLE: Curators Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples database. ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: The Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples, also known as the Core Curators' Data Base, contains inventory and basic lithology, texture, and age information for samples archived by participating oceanographic institutions and government agencies, in the U.S., Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Most samples are available for further study, on request from the individual repository. Listings from the file include institutional contact information. Data are coded at the curatorial facility and include ship, cruise, sample id, latitude longitude, water depth, date of sample collection, sampling device, storage method, core diameter length and interval within core (if applicable), primary and secondary lithology and texture or rock type and mineralogy, other noted components, remarks and weathering notes, age, province, principal investigator, and descriptive comments. All samples include basic collection information, but not all samples have additional descriptors. The Index includes over 250,000 data records containing information for over 128,000 discrete sea floor and lakebed cores, grabs, dredges, and drill samples worldwide, as of June 2006.

TITLE: SHEBA Upper Ocean CTD and Thermal Microstructure, Western Arctic Ocean. ABSTRACT: This data set includes conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements along with thermal microstructure data (such as, turbulent thermal variance, turbulent kinetic energy, and vertical temperature gradient) collected from 12 October 1997 to 30 September 1998. The storage, redistribution, and ultimate release of the energy contributed by incoming shortwave radiation has major effects on the thickness and seasonal evolution of sea ice cover and the state of the upper ocean. As part of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) project, this research was designed to (1) investigate upper ocean processes and their role in ice-albedo feedback, and (2) develop and test suitable models or parameterizations for use in large-scale simulations. Data are in space-delimited ASCII text format and are available via FTP..

TITLE: IABP Drifting Buoy Pressure, Temperature, Position, and Interpolated Ice Velocity. ABSTRACT: The International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) maintains a network of drifting buoys to provide meteorological and oceanographic data for real-time operational requirements and research purposes including support to the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Watch (WWW) Programme. An average of 25 buoys are in service at any time. The IABP drifting buoy data products described here are 12-hour interpolated pressure, temperature, position, and ice velocity grids available by year from 1979 through the present. Drifting buoys measure atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and other geophysical quantities. These data are processed at the University of Washington's Polar Science Center, and are interpolated to produce gridded fields. Data are usually updated by May of each year, and are available online from the Polar Science Center. NSIDC catalogs the data set and provides this documentation with links to the Polar Science Center's IABP site in order to publicize and facilitate access to the data. Several related data sets are available from the Polar Science Center's IABP site, including a CD-ROM containing IABP data and derived products from 1979 through 1999, an ocean buoy data set with temperature and salinity from drifting buoys from 1985 through 1994, GIF files graphically depicting gridded products, and a surface air temperature (SAT) data set (the IABP POLES SAT data set) that combines data from buoys, manned drifting stations, and meteorological land stations..

TITLE: Svalbard Fjord Conductivity, Temperature, Depth Data, 2001-2004. ABSTRACT: This data set includes vertical ocean profiles of temperature, salinity and backscatter beneath ice cover in Svalbard Fjord, Norway. The data were collected by a Seabird Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) system mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on three trips: the north side of Van Mijenfjorden in March 2001; the south of Van Mijenfjorden in March 2004; the south of Van Mijenfjorden in June 2004. To address the differences between theory and observation regarding the rate of ice formation, supercooling in the ocean boundary layer, and the effective diffusivities of heat and salt, the small-scale physics of sea ice formation were studied. This data set is available as tab-delimited ASCII text files, sizes 32 KB to 2,033 KB..

TITLE: International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences. ABSTRACT: Society would benefit greatly from the ability to efficiently allocate resources to minimize disruptions caused by climate change. This requires the ability to predict the response of future climate to natural and anthropogenic forcing on time scales of months to centuries. To do so we need to understand how the sun, ocean, land, atmosphere, and cryosphere interact to create the climate that controls so many aspects of our daily lives. One of the ways the science community develops this understanding is to study the earth's climate history. By learning how and why the climate changed in the past, we will be able to make better predictions of how the climate will change in the future. Ice sheets and glaciers contain well-ordered accumulations of ancient ice that fell as snow years to millions of years ago. The dust particles, soluble chemicals, and gases trapped in the ice are routinely used to study how the climate system operated in the past, and how it will operate in the future. To sample this ice, an international community of scientists and engineers drill into ice and collect ice cores. The information from ice core programs helps explain how climate changes occur throughout the world, not just at the site at which the core was drilled. This is possible because most of the material in the core, such as dust and gases, is representative of large regions. Ice coring projects range in size from a single investigator working for a single field season, to multi-national, multi-year efforts. Investigations using ice cores have documented how climate varied naturally before anthropogenic influences, and have shown there is a tight link between temperature and the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Ice core data have become central to our understanding of past climate change, and to assessments of possible future climate change. Ice core investigations are now a major branch of climate research, and the complexity of ice core projects has increased accordingly. To meet the expectations of the climate research community, increasingly complex future ice coring projects will require international collaboration. In March 2004, representatives from the international ice coring research community convened a workshop to develop concepts for the projects that are needed to predict both natural and anthropogenic climate change. The International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS) Workshop was supported by the U.S National Science Foundation. Fifty-five scientists, engineers, and funding agency representatives from Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States attended the workshop. The major recommendations of the workshop are: -Continue the Dialogue. Representatives of the international ice coring community should meet in 2005 to discuss implementation of current plans, and then continue to have regular meetings that include the exchange of information on ice core science and drilling that will be helpful to future and ongoing projects. Heinz Miller, on behalf of the European Polar Board, stated that Europe would like to host a follow-up IPICS meeting during 2005. -Retrieve Longest Possible Antarctic Ice Core Climate Record. A program should be initiated to collect an Antarctic ice core climate record longer than 1.2 million years. This program will provide insights into the way future climate will respond to changes in the distribution of solar heating, by examining how natural changes, driven by changes in the earths orbit, evolved over this long time frame. Initially this will require a multi-year effort to locate the optimal drilling locations for the collection of cores to address this topic. Ice cores should be collected from at least two locations in East Antarctica. The site selection work should be initiated during the International Polar Year. Additional workshops should be held to develop a framework for this program. -Longest Possible Arctic Ice Core Climate Record. A program should be initiated to collect the longest possible Arctic ice core climate record, with the specific goal of completely penetrating ice deposited the last time the earth was in a warm (interglacial) state like today. This program will provide critical insights into the natural variability of our current climate and, by elucidating how the last warm period ended, may yield information on how the current warm period will end. The optimal location for this project has been narrowed down to a small area in northwest Greenland. A minor amount of additional site selection work, which could occur early in the International Polar Year, is required before drilling can proceed. Preparations for the drilling could be completed by the end of the International Polar Year. Additional workshops should be held to develop a detailed plan for this program. -Spatial Array of Ice Cores. A program should be initiated to collect a spatial array of ice cores on time scales ranging from centuries to millennia. Many climate questions can only be answered if there is a well-designed spatial array to investigate how hemisphere-scale climate phenomena interact to create climate, and a coordinated effort is required to develop such an array. The individual coring projects that make up the array should be facilitated, but not directed, at the international level. This program would include polar sites with records extending into the last glacial period, and a worldwide distribution of sites with higher time resolution records extending through the last millennium. Some of the smaller individual projects that make up this program could be completed during the International Polar Year. The site selection for some of the larger individual projects that make up this program could be initiated during the International Polar Year. Additional workshops should be held to develop a planning document for an international body to facilitate the development of this global array. -Improve Ice Coring Methods. An ongoing international effort to improve ice coring methods should be initiated. This effort would focus on improving drilling fluids, core quality, drilling efficiency, and replicate coring methods. This effort could be facilitated with annual workshops and international exchanges of drilling staff. To reach the objective of being able to predict future climate variations, a new international approach to ice coring is required. Implementing these recommendations is a necessary step towards reaching that objective. To view the full report, please see: http:  www.nicl-smo.unh.edu IPICS IPICSWorkshop.pdf.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua and SeaWiFS Level 3 9KM Yearly Merged Chlorophyll Product. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of merged satellite measurements of global ocean chlorophyll data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform, and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWIFS), in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). MODIS Aqua processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html . SeaWiFS processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS SW_proc.html . The Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS Level-3 9 km merged chlorophyll products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal and annual time periods once the refined products for each of the contributing missions are processed. Increased coverage over the single mission product is realized through the merging of the two data sets. There is a substantial improvement (> 50%) in coverage at the daily level, decreasing with the increase in the temporal period binned. The MODIS SeaWiFS merged product is generated in essentially two steps. First, the MODIS Level-3 file is reduced in resolution from 4 to 9 km to match the global resolution of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll product. This involves combining the sum and sum squared field values for the (typically) four 4 km bins into the corresponding single 9 km bin. In the second step, the reduced-resolution MODIS file and the corresponding SeaWiFS Level-3 file are combined. Because both input files are at the same 9 km resolution, the summing is performed bin-by-bin. The Standard Mapped Image file that is generated from the merged Level-3 binned file stores scaled 16 bit integer values rather than the usual 8 bit values, giving the user much greater numerical precision. The actual images displayed on the Ocean Color website in PNG format are provided for visual inspection only.

TITLE: I. Dissemination Area Reference Maps, by Census Division, for Areas Outside Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, (2001 Census), Canada. ABSTRACT: The set of Dissemination Area Reference Maps by Census Division covers areas outside census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs). Each map in the set covers one census division (CD) and shows the boundaries and codes of dissemination areas within that CD. The maps also show the boundaries of census subdivisions, census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, as well as urban areas and representative points for designated places. The maps include background information such as rivers, lakes, railroad tracks and provincial boundaries, and other significant features. There are approximately 600 maps in this set?generally two maps per census division. Some maps include insets to show detail for the congested areas. These insets appear on the main map where possible, but in some cases they appear on a second map sheet. The maps vary in scale and size; the maximum dimensions are approximately 91 cm by 101 cm (36 inches by 40 inches). A reference guide is available (92F0146GIE). Note: Dissemination area reference maps are also available by census tract for large urban centres?census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations (92F0146XCB, 92F0146XIB, 92F0146XPB) and by small urban centres?non-tracted census agglomerations (92F0147XCB, 92F0147XIB, 92F0147XPB). Together, the three sets of dissemination area maps cover all of Canada.

TITLE: MODIS Aqua Level 3 Global Ocean Mapped 4 KM Monthly Climatology Ocean Color Products. ABSTRACT: This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean color products are processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details can be found at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS MODISA_processing.html The Aqua MODIS Level 3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are integer representations of binned data products. This image is an 8-bit, two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical projection of the globe. (The capability to produce 16-bit SMI products has been implemented by the OBPG, and the MODIS Ocean Color products are expected to be regenerated as 16-bits values at the next reprocessing in about 1 year.) Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file. The Level 3 binned products are used to generate mapped data products on 4 and 9 km equi-rectangular projection. The products are generated for the following binning periods: Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative. Five SMI products are generated from each standard Ocean Color binned data product, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: -Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLO) -Normalized water-leaving radiance at band 5 (L551) -Aerosol optical thickness at band 8 for atmospheric correction (T869) -Angstrom coefficient, 531-869 nm, for atmospheric correction (A531) -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (measure of optical clarity) (K490) Each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. More detailed information on the Level-3 Standard Mapped Image data product format specifications can be found in the document at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov DOCS Ocean_Level-3_SMI_Products.pdf Please, read the MODIS Ocean Parent document for more details: http:  gcmd.nasa.gov getdif.htm?MODIS_OCEAN_PARENT Browse Level 3 Standard Mapped Images (SMI) at http:  oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov cgi level3.pl The Aqua MODIS Level 3 Mapped data files are available from the FTP site at ftp:  oceans.gsfc.nasa.gov MODISA Mapped .

TITLE: European Register of Marine Species. ABSTRACT: The European Register of Marine Species (ERMS) is a register of marine species in Europe to facilitate marine biodiversity research and management. The foundation of biodiversity research and management is correctly identifying and naming species. This project will produce a register of marine species in Europe, linked with a bibliography of identification guides, register of taxonomic experts, locations of collections of reference specimens, and an Information Pack on European marine biodiversity. The species register is novel in its geographic extent, range of taxa covered, and use of state-of-the-art World Wide Web software for publication and networking. It is anticipated that the Register will become a standard reference (and technological tool) for marine biodiversity training, research and management in Europe. The project started in April 1998 and will end in March 2000. People interested, especially those with expertise in marine taxa, are invited to contact the co-ordinator or other participants to get on the project circulation list. The European Register of Marine Species (ERMS) is produced by a research consortium funded by the European Union under the Marine Science and Technology (MAST) programme.

TITLE: Level 2.5 daily AMSR satellite wind speeds with assigned directions (1987-2007) (Ardizzone et al.). ABSTRACT: This data set combines data derived from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM I), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Quikscat and other missions using a variational analysis method (VAM) to produce a consistent climatological record of ocean surface winds at 25 km resolution and provide near real-time support for numerical weather prediction and ENSO related studies. Data has been processed beginning with the operational phase of the F8 DMSP SSM I in July 1987 and is ongoing. It represents a continuation and expansion of the SSM I surface wind velocity data set under the NASA Pathfinder Program (see http:  podaac.jpl.nasa.gov products product079.html ). The data products will be distributed via the JPL PODAAC for research and near-real time operational support. Satellite surface wind data are obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, http:  www.remss.com  ). RSS uses a more accurate sea-surface emissivity model resulting in much better consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (SSM I, AMSR, TMI) and those from scatterometers (NSCAT and Seawinds). All observations are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The conventional data used in the analyses is obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These consist of all ship and buoy observations of surface wind. Additional buoy data is obtained from the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project (TAO, http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov tao  ). When available, buoys from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) are also used ( http:  www.pmel.noaa.gov pirata  ). All conventional observations are adjusted to a height of 10 meters assuming neutral stability. When unavailable, instrument heights are assumed to be 19.5m and 5m for ships and buoys respectively. Background analyses of U and V winds as a starting estimate of the wind field are obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR ( http:  dss.ucar.edu datasets  ). Two product streams are produced: First-look (FLK) and Late-look (LLK). FLK products use the ECMWF Operational Analysis (DS111.1) as a background and are available within 6-months of real-time. LLK products use the ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis (DS117.0) as a background. The Level 2.5 products are derived from the Level 3.0 gridded VAM analyses by assigning directions daily to the wind speed observations for each microwave sensor (DMSP SSM I, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI). Data products are stored in binary "bytemap" files to parallel the original satellite data files from RSS. All observations are mapped to a 25 km grid and packed into 1-byte integers. Data distributed in NetCDF format ( http:  www.unidata.ucar.edu software netcdf  ). All data sets contain U and V components of the wind in m s. Each data set is archived using the following naming convention: NAME_YYYYMMDD_vVVlLLPPP.TTT.gz where NAME - unique identifier describing the data YYYYMMDD - date time expressed as year, month, day VV - product version number (in tenths) LL - product level designation (in tenths) PPP - product stream (flk or llk) TTT - file type designating the data format For example, "amsre_20040101_v10l25flk.nc.gz" designates a level 2.5 (l25) data set containing AMSR-E satellite wind speeds with assigned directions for January 1, 2004 from version 1.0 (v10) of the first-look (flk) product stream in NetCDF (.nc) format. The ".gz" node indicates that the file must first be de-compressed using the GNU zip (gzip) compression utility..

TITLE: Cenozoic Diatom First and Last Appearance Data. ABSTRACT: Location and age data for first and last appearance of Diatom taxa in the global ocean. Abstract (from the online documentation) First and last occurrences of 389 diatom species from the first global Cenozoic record are used to reconstruct the position of major oceanographic boundaries. First appearances and extinctions group in three latitudinal bands: middle to high northern latitudes, equatorial region, and high southern latitudes. Sparse Paleogene occurrences were limited to southern high latitudes along the equivalent of the modern Antarctic polar front. Its late middle Eocene to middle Miocene position varied within 10B0, and within a 20B0 band from middle Miocene to present, suggesting an association with global cooling. First and last occurrence events appear in the two remaining latitudinal regions during the Eocene and increase in a stepwise fashion, mimicking significant cooling events. At about 16 Ma, first and last appearances shift from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific. Low-latitude data suggest low surface water productivity prior to 40 Ma, while increased abundance from the middle Miocene correlates with expansion of the east Antarctic Ice Sheet..

TITLE: Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) Program Network. ABSTRACT: The CALM network currently includes 130 active sites in both hemispheres, with 15 participating countries. An additional 20 or more secondary sites are co-located with these primary sites, resulting in a total over 150 sites that report active-layer thickness on an annual basis. 100 sites collect soil and permafrost temperature data; of these, 60 are from boreholes. Maximum active layer thickness is interpolated from these temperature profiles. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands, although 20 boreholes are in mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere above 1300 m elevation. A new Antarctic component is being organized and currently includes 13 sites. The active layer thickness is measured by physical probing on grids ranging in size from 100 to 1000 meters, by probing at a single point or along transects or from permanently installed frost tubes and soil temperature cables. Sites include several coastal to inland transects in North America, a longitudinal array of sites across Eurasia, and individual sites in several mid-latitude, mountainous regions. The majority of the sites are in arctic tundra regions consisting of fine grained sediments. Bouldery and rocky sites in mountains are being added to the network primarily in Europe as part of the EC Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project. CALM is being considered as the part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). CALM is closely affiliated with the International Permafrost Association (IPA), several IPA working groups, and the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The current protocol for observing the active layer thickness is given in the published ITEX Manual and on the ITEX and IPA web sites. These activities are part of the IPA Global Geocryological Database (GGD). A map on the CAPS CD-ROM illustrates the locations of the 130 sites. A comprehensive metadata file for all sites is available. The CAPS CD-ROM contains detailed metadata and summary data. Raw data can be found at the CALM (http:  www.udel.edu Geography calm ) web site..

TITLE: Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database. ABSTRACT: This application of the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database illustrates the locations of radiocarbon-dated archaeological and palaeobiological sites near the time of the last glacial maximum and thereafter for the past 14 millennia. The maps reveal the spread of ancient cultures and animals across a continent newly released from the grip of the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets as elucidated by the Geological Survey of Canada (Dyke and Prest, 1986).Selected sites not dated by radiocarbon are also shown to depict the spread of Palaeoindian and Archaic cultures. There are, of course, many other undated occurrences of cultural and animal remains, and it is hoped that this presentation will encourage researchers to fill in the gaps by selecting appropriate samples for radiocarbon dating. The earliest time period in this database presents environmental conditions as of 18 000 years ago, i.e. the "Glacial Maximum" in North America, with sites ranging in age from 19 500 to 14 500 years ago. Each of the younger maps depicts paleoenvironmental conditions (animation) reconstructed at one millenium intervals with dated sites ranging from 500 years older to 500 years younger than the nominal millenium. Most of the paleobiological sites shown here contain the remains of large mammals whose presence signals that the landscape was suitable for human habitation. The dated archeological sites show that people responded quickly to new opportunities by inhabiting recently deglaciated terrain. By 4500 years ago, people were living throughout North America, including the High Arctic.

TITLE: Catalog of Earthquake Hypocenters at Alaskan Volcanoes: January 1,1994 through December 31, 1999; USGS. ABSTRACT: Between 1994 and 1999, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) seismic monitoring program underwent significant changes with networks added at new volcanoes during each summer from 1995 through 1999. The existing network at Katmai ?Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (VTTS) was repaired in 1995, and new networks were installed at Makushin (1996), Akutan (1996), Pavlof (1996), Katmai - south (1996), Aniakchak (1997), Shishaldin (1997), Katmai - north (1998), Westdahl, (1998), Great Sitkin (1999) and Kanaga (1999). These networks added to AVO's existing seismograph networks in the Cook Inlet area and increased the number of AVO seismograph stations from 46 sites and 57 components in 1994 to 121 sites and 155 components in 1999. The 1995?1999 seismic network expansion increased the number of volcanoes monitored in real-time from 4 to 22, including Mount Spurr, Redoubt Volcano, Iliamna Volcano, Augustine Volcano, Mount Snowy, Mount Griggs, Mount Katmai, Novarupta, Trident Volcano, Mount Mageik, Mount Martin, Aniakchak Crater, Pavlof Volcano, Mount Dutton, Isanotski volcano, Shisaldin Volcano, Fisher Caldera, Westdahl volcano, Akutan volcano, Makushin Volcano, Great Sitkin volcano, and Kanaga Volcano (see Figures 1-15). The network expansion also increased the number of earthquakes located from about 600 per year in 1994 and 1995 to about 3000 per year between 1997 and 1999. Highlights of the catalog period include: 1) a large volcanogenic seismic swarm at Akutan volcano in March and April 1996 (Lu and others, 2000); 2) an eruption at Pavlof Volcano in fall 1996 (Garces and others, 2000; McNutt and others, 2000); 3) an earthquake swarm at Iliamna volcano between September and December 1996; 4) an earthquake swarm at Mount Mageik in October 1996 (Jolly and McNutt, 1999); 5) an earthquake swarm located at shallow depth near Strandline Lake; 6) a strong swarm of earthquakes near Becharof Lake; 7) precursory seismicity and an eruption at Shishaldin Volcano in April 1999 that included a 5.2 ML earthquake and aftershock sequence (Moran and others, in press; Thompson and others, in press). The 1996 calendar year is also notable as the seismicity rate was very high, especially in the fall when 3 separate areas (Strandline Lake, Iliamna Volcano, and several of the Katmai volcanoes) experienced high rates of located earthquakes. This catalog covers the period from January 1, 1994, through December 31,1999, and includes: 1) earthquake origin times, hypocenters, and magnitudes with summary statistics describing the earthquake location quality; 2) a description of instruments deployed in the field and their locations and magnifications; 3) a description of earthquake detection, recording, analysis, and data archival; 4) velocity models used for earthquake locations; 5) phase arrival times recorded at individual stations; and 6) a summary of daily station usage from throughout the report period. We have made calculated hypocenters, station locations, system magnifications, velocity models, and phase arrival information available for download via computer network as a compressed Unix tar file..

ABSTRACT: Landsat imagery at the University of Alaska's Geophysical Institute includes data covering Alaska and the surrounding areas since 1972. The collection is comprised primarily of Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) data, although data from the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and Thematic Mapper (TM) are also included. The MSS provides repetitive acquisition of high-resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis. This sensor package images a 100 nautical mile (185 km) wide swath directly below the satellite as it passes over the Earth. Each scene, or frame of data, covers an area 100 by 100 n. miles in size. The nominal size of a pixel (picture element) for this sensor is 80 meters on a side. Four separate bands (wavelengths) are recorded by the MSS: Green 0.5-0.6 microns Red 0.6-0.7 microns Near IR1 0.7-0.8 microns Near IR2 0.8-1.1 microns Initially data were acquired directly from NASA, and were a subset of the holdings of the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Starting in 1978, additional images were acquired from the Canadian Centre for Remote Sensing. From 1982 to 1991, most of the coverage was acquired by the Geophysical Institute Quick Look Project, which operated recording equipment at the NOAA Gilmore Tracking Station near Fairbanks. Scenes in the database that were acquired by the Quick-Look program are so indicated. Much of this data IS NOT in the EROS Data Center's data base and is therefore UNIQUE to this collection. TM and RBV data included in the collection originally came from NASA, the EROS Data Center or EOSAT, depending on the time of acquisition. Their characteristics are described in the references listed for the collection..

TITLE: Iditarod George Resource Management Area; USGS, Alaska. ABSTRACT: Since the early 1980's the EROS Alaska Field Office (AFO) has been involved in the acquisition, classification, and analysis of digital land cover data over the State of Alaska, and to a limited extent, northwestern Canada and Wrangle Island, Russia. The digital data currently covers approximately 77% of the land and water within the boundaries of the State of Alaska. These data are currently being made available via the AFO web site to land managers and researchers who may be interested in land cover conditions over various portions of Alaska. The land cover maps as a result of digital analysis of Landsat multispectral scanner, Landsat thematic mapper, and SPOT multispectral scanner satellite data. Some data however, are missing from the database due to data degradation on storage media or loss of data tapes, although a limited number of hard copy map products may be in existence, for example, U.S. Forest Service land cover data for southeast Alaska. The land cover data are stored online in a series of directories and are available via the web. Each directory name is indicative of the area for which the land cover data exists. Some directories connote a U.S. Geological Survey 1:250,000 quadrangle (for example, anchorage_int), while others indicate a particular project area (for example, anwr represents Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) or the agency responsible for producing the data. For example, nowitna.fws indicates that the data were produced for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Directories with an '_int' suffix denote that the data correspond to the Interim Landcover Mapping project. Each directory contains five files with the following extensions: .bil, .blw, .hdr, .prj, and .stx. As a group, one or more of the files can be read by most image analysis and GIS software packages. The .bil file contains the binary raster land cover data and the others are ASCII files. The .bil file does not contain any header or footer records, and can be easily imported into image processing software by using the information contained in the .blw and .hdr files. The .blw file provides pixel size information as well as the upper left corner coordinate. The .hdr contains number of rows and columns of the data set, as well as band format (band interleave). The .prj file gives projection information, and the .stx file gives information on minimum maximum  mean values of the data. Projection parameters for the data sets are either in Universal Transverse Projection (UTM) or Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic..

TITLE: MMS Oregon Washington Miller Freeman Cruise (Birds). ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Oregon And Washington Marine Mammal And Seabird Surveys Studies: -- Oregon Washington Ship [Bird and Mammal Observations] Study Code: MF Contract Number: 14-12-0001-30426 Principal Investigator(s) Affiliation: G. A. Green, Ebasco Environmental, Bellevue, Washington, M. L. Bonnell and K. T. Briggs, Ecological Consulting, Inc., Portland, Oregon PURPOSE: OBJECTIVES: Objectives of the study were to review and analyze all available literature and databases concerning marine mammal and seabird diversity, distribution, and abundance in the Oregon-Washington coastal and offshore areas; to conduct field surveys over a 18-month period and to prepare reports summarizing the findings. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: DATA COLLECTION: TIME PERIOD: April 1989 through October 1990 STUDY AREA: Pacific Ocean waters of Oregon and Washington from the coast to approximately 60 nautical miles offshore. METHODOLGY: Aerial surveys were conducted along 32 pre-established transects designed to systematically sample marine mammal and seabird abundance in all waters of the study area. Coastal surveys and one shelf break survey were also conducted. Standard transects provided systematic coverage of shelf, slope, and offshore waters in the study area. Sightings of seabirds, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and turtles were recorded. Seabird sightings were recorded only on the shaded side of the aircraft within a strip transect of 50 m width. Marine mammal and turtle sightings were recorded within an unbounded corridor. Declination angle was measured and noted for each marine mammal turtle sightings and later used to calculate a probability density function of frequency with right-angle sighting distance. Navigation was by Loran and VLF-Omega. One ship survey was also conducted from aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman during August 1989. DATABASES PRODUCED: Databases produced include 1) sightings of seabirds and marine mammals on 12 aerial surveys and one ship cruise, and 2) sightings of cetaceans on 12 aerial surveys and one ship cruise.

TITLE: BIOME 6000 (v4.2): Vegetation Maps for the Mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. ABSTRACT: The Palaeovegetation Mapping Project (generally known as BIOME 6000: Prentice and Webb, 1998) was inaugurated in 1994 with the aim of providing global maps describing the vegetation patterns at 6000±500 yr B.P. (on the radiocarbon time scale) and the last glacial maximum (defined as 18,000±1000 yr B.P. on the radiocarbon time scale, equivalent to 21,000 yr B.P. on the calendar time scale) for use by the modelling community. The BIOME 6000 project has used a standard methodology to map vegetation patterns using fossil pollen and plant-macrofossil data from individual sites. The taxa represented in the pollen or plant-macrofossil assemblages are first allocated to plant functional types (PFTs) on the basis of the life form, leaf form, phenology and bioclimatic tolerance of the plant species included within the taxon. Because of the lack of taxonomic resolution in pollen identification, some taxa can be classified into more than one PFT. Biomes (i.e. major vegetation types at a regional scale) are defined by combinations of PFTs, where these combinations usually include both characteristic and dominant groups. Some PFTs which are known to occur within a given biome are not included in the biome definition because they occur in too many biomes to provide discriminatory power. Once the taxon to PFT and PFT to biome classifications are made, the affinity of pollen or plant-macrofossil assemblages from individual sites for each biome is calculated. Each assemblage is allocated to the biome for which it has the highest affinity. In cases where the assemblage has equal affinity for more than one biome, which can occur when one biome is defined by a subset of the PFTs that characterise another biome, the assemblage is allocated to the biome defined by the subset. The published version of the BIOME 6000 database (Version 3: Prentice et al., 2000) was based on maps produced on a region by region basis over a number of years. Here, we have fused the information from the various regions and standardised the biome names. We recognise 40 biomes, using names that are broadly consistent with the BIOME4 equilibrium biogeography-biochemistry model (Kaplan et al., 2003). Since Version 3 of the BIOME 6000 database was released, there have been three new palaeovegetation mapping initiatives. Harrison et al. (2001) added a number of sites from the continental shelf east of China which date to the last glacial maximum. The Pan-Arctic Initiative (PAIN) extended the site coverage from the high-northern latitudes at both 6000 yr B.P. and the last glacial maximum (Bigelow et al., 2003). Pickett et al. (2004) extended the coverage to the SEAPAC (South East Asia and the Pacific) region at both 6000 yr B.P. and the last glacial maximum. These data sets are included in the current version of the BIOME 6000 data set (Version 4.2). BIOME 6000 Version 4.2 has records for 11166 modern sites, 1794 sites at 6000 yr B.P., and 318 sites at 18,000 yr B.P. This data set is also available from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison project - Phase II: http:  www-lsce.cea.fr pmip2 synth vegmaps.shtml An early version of this data set is available from the WDC Paleoclimatology http:  www.ncdc.noaa.gov paleo biome6000.html.

TITLE: Long-Term Monitoring of Signy Lake Chemistry by BAS 1963-2004. ABSTRACT: The long term monitoring of water chemistry in Signy Island lakes is unique in polar limnology, in its duration (30+ years), detail, and range of sites. It details seasonal patterns of snow and ice cover, inorganic nutrient status and chlorophyll-a and includes vertical profiles of various physical chemical parameters. There are detailed data for several study lakes and twice thrice yearly analyses for all the Signy Island lakes. Temperature and light climate has been studied in certain lakes using automatic data loggers. Micrometeorological monitoring with additional data loggers provided data on solar radiation (PAR, UVR), air temperature, humidity and wind conditions. Data are collected by chemical analysis, use of temperature, pH light probes and observation. The ''grand prix'' was the sampling of 16 lakes in a short period (approx. one week), this was carried out perhaps two or three times a year. Approximately three to five lakes were sampled monthly or fortnightly in m ore detail, these were representative of the 16 lakes. Comparative studies were also undertaken in the Arctic. The long-term programme was established in 1971, although some observations were made in 1963 1964 and 1969 1970. The programme finished in 2004. The data are held in an ORACLE database system maintained by the Biological Sciences Data and Resource Centre. The British Antarctic Survey Archives Service holds records on this study (LS2 6). As the exact months of the data collection were not provided, and the metadata standard requires a YYYY-MM-DD format, this dataset has been dated as 1st January for start date, and 31st December for stop date..

TITLE: Cryosolic Pedons from Northern Canada. ABSTRACT: Pedons included here represent Cryosolic (permafrost-affected) soils from across the Canadian North from Baffin Island in the east, to the lower Mackenzie Valley and northern Yukon in the west, and to Ellesmere Island in the High Arctic. Pedon locations are Pangnirtung Pass, Baffin Island, N.W.T. (8 pedons); Inuvik area, N.W.T. (2 pedons); Mackenzie Delta, N.W.T. (2 pedons); Tanquary Fiord, Ellesmere Island, N.W.T. (4 pedons); Lake Hazen, Ellesmere Island, N.W.T. (4 pedons); Eagle Plains, northern Yukon (3 pedons); Dawson City area, central Yukon (2 pedons). Cryosolic soils, according to the Canadian soil classification, are either mineral or organic materials that have permafrost either within 1 m of the surface (Static and Organic Cryosols) or within 2 m (Turbic Cryosols) if more than one-third of the pedon has been strongly cryoturbated, as indicated by disrupted, mixed, or broken horizons. They have a mean annual temperature below 0 degree C. In the soil profile descriptions, the perennially frozen (permafrost) soil horizons are identified by the letter 'z'. The descriptions and nomenclature used to describe these pedons are according to - Expert Committee on Soil Survey. 1983. The Canada Soil Information System, Manual for describing soil in the field. Agriculture Canada, Ottawa, Canada. Agriculture Canada Expert Committee on Soil Survey. 1987. The Canadian System of Soil Classification. (2nd ed.) Research Branch, Agriculture Canada, Ottawa, Canada. The methods for laboratory analysis are according to - Sheldrick, B.H. (editor). 1984. Analytical Methods Manual. 1984.
